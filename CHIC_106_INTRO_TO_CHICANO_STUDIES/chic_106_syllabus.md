### Latinx Lab for Storytelling and Social Justice (2022-25) Description & Website 
Funded by a 3-year Mellon Foundation grant, the Latinx Lab for Storytelling and Social Justice is a series of in-person and virtual projects led by faculty in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at CSUF. These projects center on storytelling as essential to creating vital and transformative knowledge.

The Latinx Lab aims to inspire our students to use storytelling to uncover marginalized stories and experiences and share their narratives while building community and engaging in social activism. Our students' stories are more important now than ever to address structural racism, to find healing, to imagine more just futures, and to forge new compassionate and joyful relationships and experiences. https://hss.fullerton.edu/latinxlab/about.html

## What does this class fulfill? It fulfills:

### I. GENERAL EDUCATION STATEMENT

**What GE Requirement does this class fulfill?**  
All CSUF students are assigned a "Catalog Year" that determines the requirements for their degree program, including requirements in their major(s) and in General Education. The CSU and CSUF occasionally modify graduation requirements. You can find your catalog year on your TDA. For more information, please visit: https://www.fullerton.edu/undergraduate/generaleducation/approved-courses.html.

For students with a Catalog Year of Fall 2025 or beyond, CHIC 106 fulfills the following GE Requirement: **GE AREA 6**

An "Ethnic Studies course" is a course taught by faculty from the African American Studies, Asian American Studies, and Chicana and Chicano Studies Departments and identified in the catalog as taught through the African American Studies, Asian American Studies, and Chicana and Chicano Studies Departments as the home departments, if cross-listed.

Only the Ethnic Studies Requirement Committee may interpret the California State University core competencies for the Ethnic Studies Requirement into CSUF GE Area F learning objectives to be used to select courses to fulfill the requirement. Courses that satisfy the Ethnic Studies requirement shall meet learning objectives that address at least three of the five CSU core competencies. Courses in F may be upper-division courses so long as adequate numbers of lower-division course options in area 6 are available to students. 

Students completing courses in Area 6 shall: 

**1a.** (For lower division courses) Identify, define and interpret core concepts such as race, racism, racialization, ethnicity, equity, ethno-centrism, eurocentrism, white supremacy, self-determination, liberation, decolonization, sovereignty, anti-racism, migration, labor systems, settler colonialism, imperialism, citizenship, and immigration in any one or more of the following disciplines: African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicanx/a/o and Latinx/a/o Studies, and Native American Studies. Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 1.

**1b.** (For upper division courses) Analyze, evaluate, and apply core concepts such as race, racism, racialization, ethnicity, equity, ethno-centrism, eurocentrism, white supremacy, self-determination, liberation, decolonization, sovereignty, anti-racism migration, labor systems, settler colonialism, imperialism, citizenship, and immigration in any one or more of the following disciplines: African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicanx/a/o and Latinx/a/o Studies, and Native American Studies.

Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 2.

**3.** Describe and critically analyze the intersection of race with forms of difference affected by systems and hierarchies of oppression, for example:
• structural racism 
• capitalism, genocide
• sexism, heterosexism
• ableism
• political and cultural representation in African American, Asian American, Chicanx/a/o and Latinx/a/o, and/or Native American communities. Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 3.

**4.** Demonstrate knowledge of and critically analyze creative activities and imagination such as poetry, performance, music, media, and popular culture in African American, Asian American, Chicanx/a/o and Latinx/a/o, and/or Native American communities. Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 3.

Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 4.

**6.** Describe, document, and critically reflect on engagement with community issues focused on anti-racist and anti-colonial issues, and the practices and movements in African American, Asian American, Chicanx/a/o and Latinx/a/o, and/or Native American communities to build a just and equitable society. Addresses CSU GE Area F core competency 5.

As indicated in UPS 411.201, "Courses that satisfy the Ethnic Studies requirement shall meet learning objectives that address at least three of the five CSU core competencies." 
https://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20400/UPS%20411.201.pdf

### Writing Requirement
Additionally, this course satisfies the GE Writing Requirement. 

UPS 411.201 also stipulates that all GE courses shall have a writing component: "General education courses shall include writing assignments appropriate to the course, and, when compatible with the learning goals for a course, appropriate instruction in information competency. Writing assignments in General Education courses shall involve the organization and expression of complex data or ideas and careful and timely evaluations of writing so that deficiencies are identified and suggestions for improvement and/or for means of remediation are offered. Assessments of the student's writing competence shall be used in determining the final course grade." 

CHIC 106 meets and assesses the General Education Writing Requirement through reading logs (IIQs), Creative Projects, Midterm, and Final. For example, for the creative project, students will be asked to think creatively about the course and apply concepts and themes relevant to the course creatively and in their artist's statement. Also, students will be asked each week to identify important concepts that stood out in the reading and to pose a critical question in their work. 

### Chicana/o Studies Department Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
The following Student Learning Outcomes are for students pursuing a degree in Ethnic Studies, Option in Chicana and Chicano Studies: 

**SLO-1:** Use theories and concepts in Chicanx/Latinx Studies to identify, analyze, and contest systems of oppression, such as anti-blackness, homophobia, sexism, ableism, xenophobia, and policing. 

**SLO-2:** Gain confidence and direction when planning for a sustainable life after graduation with a degree in Ethnic Studies, Option in Chicana/o Studies. 

**SLO-3:** Prepare students to ask questions that challenge normative thinking continuously. 

**SLO-4:** Lead with cariño, grounded in ancestral knowledge and contributing to emerging knowledge, where humanness is centered in our scholarship, creative expression, and social action. 

This course will focus on SLOs-1, introducing students to theories and concepts in Chicanx/Latinx Studies. Specifically, you will see this in the IIQs, where students will aim to identify important and relevant concepts/definitions from the readings. Students will also engage in a creative project that will have them apply theories and concepts discussed in the course, along with a midterm and a reflective final that will aid in further understanding a foundation in Chicana/o/x Studies.

- Final 15%

### Participation (15%) 
Participation also includes engaging with the material, watching required lectures and films, and discussion posts. If participation becomes hard, please contact me as soon as possible. Since this is an asynchronous course, I will do my best to keep everything as accessible and open as possible. I encourage you to meet with me at least once during the semester to get to know you and check in (not required, but highly recommended). Please make sure you make your appointment with me at your earliest convenience. I ask for your cooperation and patience through it all.

I will make your lectures available by noon on Monday, and you will have until Friday by 11:59pm to do your assignments unless specified otherwise.

### IIQs—Interesting, Important Question (20%--14 entries total)
You will be required to do IIQ. Your IIQs are due Fridays by 11:59pm of the week the readings are assigned. You will be asked to:

Identify 2 Important concepts/definitions, 2 interesting things, and 1 question. 

**Important concepts and definitions.** Identify important concepts, key terms, or people and explain/define who/what they relate to the readings. Make sure that you see how the author defines/explains it in the text. (Make sure that the definition comes from the text and not the internet, please!) 

**Interesting things** are those pieces of information that you found new, surprising, or thought-provoking. These give you a chance to make judgments, to think critically about the reading, or to respond subjectively to it. 

**The critical question** will include something you didn't understand or would like to discuss in class. Think about it as a question you would like to pose to the rest of the class during the discussion. 

To complete this assignment, write down two important concepts/definitions, two interesting things, and one question. This assignment is here to help you think about the readings before coming to the lecture. You will be required to do 14 throughout the semester.

### Quizzes (35%) 
The quizzes will cover readings, films, and additional material during the winter session. You will be required to understand key terms and key moments in Chicanx studies.

This creative project will allow you to identify themes, concepts, and theories discussed in the course. We will talk a bit more about this when we meet. Some suggestions you can do are creating a TikTok, a creative art piece, an interview, an online cookbook, an infographic, etc. Along with your creative project, you will do a presentation and a write-up to share why you picked the topic and incorporate the themes and concepts discussed. 

Your target audience will be folks in the community who are being introduced to Chicana/o Studies. A proposal for the final project is due in Week 6. I will give you more details in class. The final project is due at the end of the summer session, when students will share their deliverables with the rest of the course. 

**Breakdown of Creative Project**

- Week 15—Deliverable, Write-up, & Presentation

### Final Paper (15%)
The final reflective essay will put you in conversation with the readings and your course reflections. A prompt will be given closer to the end of the semester. This will mainly be a critical reflection and your thoughts on the introductory course on Chicana/o/x Studies—due Finals Week.

## 5 Student Responsibilities and Tips for Success! 

Students should complete five items to help ensure they remain on top of this class and contribute to a thriving class.

1. Respect and adhere to online etiquette.
2. Check our CANVAS page at least twice weekly for my emails, general updates, and related class matters. 
3. Keep our Class Calendar handy. Some people transfer due dates to their phone calendar and use the "alert"/reminder feature. I do not accept late assignments/quizzes/discussion posts. No exceptions.
4. Create a Plan and Stick to It! Be On Top of It! Give yourself time for this class each week. Those who fall behind often underestimate the time one needs for this class. Do not wait until the last minute to plan, comprehend fully, and complete assignments. 
5. Request to communicate with me if you are performing below your expectations. We will explore strategies to improve your performance. 

### General Assignment Guidelines
All written assignments should be double-spaced, in Times New Roman 12-point font, with 1-inch margins, page numbers, and your last name on each page. Page limits do not include images or your bibliography. Work that is not formatted correctly or do not properly cite sources will be penalized.

---

## Course Policies

### Syllabus Changes
The instructor may modify any part of the syllabus. Students will be notified if this is the case. 

### Communication with Instructor
There are two ways to communicate with me 
1. **Email—we can discuss class and your progress**
   a. I reply to emails within 24hrs Monday-Friday 
   Email Subject: YOUR LAST NAME, CLASS NAME 
   Ex: Gomez CH 106 
   *I may not reply if you omit the section* 
2. **Via zoom.** You would have to email to set up an appointment and discuss details. The link to make an appointment with me can be found above and at different parts of CANVAS.

### Office hours 
Please take advantage of virtual office hours! This is where you can ask questions about the course. If you're feeling challenged in our class, don't be shy! That's what office hours are for. Office hours are for clarification of course readings (that you have already read) and lectures (that you have already watched or obtained notes for). 

### Deadlines 
Ideally, you will submit all assignments due on the indicated date. I will give you a window to submit make-up assignments to CANVAS, including Discussion Posts, Quizzes, and IIQs.

I will not accept late submissions to the Creative Project or Final. If it gets difficult for you to submit assignments on time, I encourage you to email me, and I'm happy to support you. 

Please note that I will only accept late work for the first eight weeks of the semester until October 17th and will only accept late work for the second half until December 5th. If not submitted by then, you will get a zero on the assignment, with no exceptions.

### Retention of Student Work 
You submit assignments/DBs/Quizzes etc., through the CANVAS course site, and I will retain your work for a reasonable time after the semester is completed. 

### Restrictions 
Redistribution of class lectures and materials to future classes is prohibited. You should not screenshot or take a picture of any material and pass these along to potential/future students.

### Academic Integrity 
Any work submitted for a grade in this course is expected to be the individual student's sole product unless otherwise permitted. Presenting work from other sources as your own is unacceptable. It will result in a 0 on the assignment and/or a notification to the Dean of Students of violating campus standards. Behaviors that seek to gain an unfair advantage or negatively impact the ability of others to learn will also result in a report to the Dean of Students. 

Cheating or other actions contrary to CSUF student conduct policies can have severe consequences. Communicate with your instructor if you are in a situation that might lead to a poor decision. 

You are encouraged to use the resources provided by your instructor. Discuss the use of other online resources with your instructor. The use of sites, including but not limited to Chegg and Course Hero, Chat GPT, which require subscriptions and provide solutions to homework problems, exam questions, etc., is prohibited in this course and is considered academic dishonesty.

Collaborating has been made more accessible by the many tools available to use on the internet (e.g., Discord, Zoom, Microsoft Teams). I encourage you to use these tools to work together, to form study groups, etc. However, sharing assignments (even if only intended to help) or using these communication tools for unauthorized collaboration is considered academic dishonesty. Unless explicitly stated by the instructor, assignments and examinations must be completed independently.

### Plagiarism 
You are not allowed to copy content from other sources to complete any assignments. I will use Turn-It-In and Google to screen for plagiarism. I can also recall written assignments from former students, and I have access to Discussion Boards from past semesters. I would not like to see any part of former students' work in any of your assignments. I will handle on a case-by-case basis any assignments that appear to be plagiarized. 

### Grade Disputes 
You have one week to dispute a grade. You may submit (1) the original graded assignment and (2) a paragraph (no more than a page) describing the reasons for which you are requesting a change of grade on an assignment (academic arguments). The re-grading may raise or lower the original grade. 

### Accessibility Accommodations 
I intend to co-create an environment in which every student feels they can access and understand course materials. Please inform (me) the instructor during the first week of classes about any disability or special needs that you may have that may require specific arrangements related to attending class sessions, carrying out class assignments, or writing papers or examinations. According to California State University policy, students with disabilities must document their disabilities at the Disability Support Services (DSS) Office in order to be accommodated in their courses. Additional information can be found at the DSS website, by calling 657-278-3112 or email dsservices@fullerton.edu. 

### Safe Space 
• My class and office are safe spaces for ALL students. My class adheres to the CSUF Resolution in Support of the U.S. 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program. You can click here to access this resolution. My class adheres to the CSUF Resolution in Support of Undocumented Students. You can click here to access this resolution. 
• Many of the conversations we will have will challenge the ideas we hold about ourselves and our place in the world. Practice respect and patience towards each other. We are creating knowledge collectively. This course will cover various topics and issues that may bring up strong feelings. Together we will work to make our online classroom a non-violent shared space by avoiding comments that are racist, sexist, misogynist, ableist, classist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic (anti-migrant), Islamophobic, or are discriminatory or disrespectful in any other way. 
• Netiquette refers to how we should behave online. You can find Netiquette guidelines here: http://www.studygs.net/netiquette.htm. Any violation of these policies will result in your dismissal from the course. 

### Emergencies: 
Students will be required to submit evidence that an emergency impaired the student's ability to complete an assignment on time.
