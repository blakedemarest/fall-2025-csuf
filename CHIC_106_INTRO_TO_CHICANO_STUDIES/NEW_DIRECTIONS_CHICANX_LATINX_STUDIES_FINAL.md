technologies to support learning.

The LibreTexts mission is to unite students, faculty and scholars in a cooperative effort to develop an easy-to-use online platform
for the construction, customization, and dissemination of OER content to reduce the burdens of unreasonable textbook costs to our
students and society. The LibreTexts project is a multi-institutional collaborative venture to develop the next generation of open-
access  texts  to  improve  postsecondary  education  at  all  levels  of  higher  learning  by  developing  an  Open  Access  Resource
environment.  The  project  currently  consists  of  14  independently  operating  and  interconnected  libraries  that  are  constantly  being
optimized by students, faculty, and outside experts to supplant conventional paper-based books. These free textbook alternatives are
organized within a central environment that is both vertically (from advance to basic level) and horizontally (across different fields)
integrated.

This book is for you.

Land Acknowledgment

We acknowledge that this important textbook was created throughout the unceded territory of California, home to nearly 200 tribal
nations, including those whose tribal lands cross colonial state boundaries. We acknowledge and honor the original Peoples and
their descendants, past, present, and emerging, of the various regions where we authors now live and work. We support ongoing
movements for tribal sovereignty and we stand in solidarity with all Indigenous peoples worldwide. A land acknowledgment is a
critical step towards working with Native communities to secure meaningful partnerships in the stewardship and protection of their
homelands and cultural resources. In this respect, we are continuously striving to be good relatives.

The image in Figure 1 titled "Native Californian Tribes" by Timara Lotah Link (Chumash Coastal Band) features text that reads
"Native People of This Place. In all of North America, California has always been home to the largest number of different Native
people  and  their  cultures.  Many  of  the  tribal  groups  on  this  map  speak  different  languages  and  have  different  traditions.  Their
homelands––established for thousands of years––extend far beyond state boundaries. These Native cultures overlap in ways that
this map cannot show, through shared resources, trade, and family relationships." The map shows the tribal areas of eight-five out
of the hundreds of California Native nations in their own languages and features a quote by Richard Bugbee (Luiseño, raised by
Kumeyaay) that reads, "Language is a reflection of our environment, unique to each area."

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 1: Foundations and Contexts

 Learning Objectives

Analyze and articulate core concepts related to identity in Chicanx and Latinx studies and the core frameworks of the
textbook, including transnational, intersectional, and relational perspectives.
Apply knowledge produced by Chicanx and Latinx communities about the origins, critical events, and cultural context of
the field, with a particular emphasis on agency, social movements, and collective self-determination.
Review a foundational overview of the textbook, including its organization, sections, and content.

Introduction

“Quien no sabe de donde viene no sabe hacia dónde va (someone who doesn’t know where they came from doesn’t know
where they are going)" — dicho

This dicho or proverb means that it is critical and important to have a sense of the past to know and understand how the present
came to be, in order to address or change what is before you. This wisdom about our past to understand the present is what drives
the field of Chicanx and Latinx studies, which, like other ethnic studies disciplines, has worked for over fifty years to provide a
more accurate understanding of the political, cultural, historical, and social contexts that shape our current-day experiences of race,
identity, community, and the disparities that plague our society. This work includes supporting the activism surrounding legislation
to legally mandate that the past and present realities of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities and the contributions
of  historically  marginalized  groups  are  taught  in  schools  through  required  ethnic  studies  courses  in  the  general  education
curriculum for K-12 and college. The field has also contributed directly to activist campaigns and community projects that combat
societal inequality and create more justice and opportunity for all.

This Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook aims to provide a comprehensive overview and introduction to key concepts,
content,  and  overall  work  in  this  area,  as  well  as  the  current  state  of  the  field.  Open  Educational  Resources  are  instructional
materials that are designed to be freely used, shared, and adapted. This textbook is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which means that it
can be directly used for any non-commercial purposes, as long as the material is fully attributed as the source and also uses the
same type of open licenses, so the material you create can be shared the same way. Regardless of the license, you must always cite
and attribute your sources.

To begin our journey in Chicanx and Latinx studies, this introductory chapter provides core information and context for learners to
help guide you through this content. We focus on new directions in Chicanx and Latinx studies, which are the areas of scholarship
being  embraced  and  advanced  by  students  and  leaders  in  the  field,  including  a  transnational  perspective  that  finds  affinity  with
marginalized communities across the globe and is inclusive of work produced outside of the U.S., an intersectional approach that
takes  multiple  identity  categories  and  systems  of  power  into  account,  and  a  relational  perspective  that  embraces  and  utilizes
comparative, interdisciplinary scholarship for the advancement of Chicanx and Latinx studies.

The overall intention of this textbook is to:

Be utilized in courses that meet college-level general education requirements in ethnic studies.
Introduce the field of Chicanx and Latinx studies, including historical debates and central topics, as well as emerging
perspectives and issues.
Provide the reader with a set of analytical tools, examples, and resources for inquiry, reflection, and action.

The Chicanx and Latinx studies discipline emerged from earlier versions of Chicano studies and Puerto Rican (Boricua) studies, in
conjunction  with  other  ethnic  studies  disciplines.  This  early  work  was  directly  inspired  by  the  student  activists  in  the  East  Los
Angeles  walkouts  and  the  ethnic  studies  movements  originating  at  Merritt  College  in  Oakland,  California,  San  Francisco  State
College (now San Francisco State University), and the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s and 70s. Chicanx and Latinx
studies  is  one  of  the  five  ethnic  studies  disciplines  that  emerged  from  this  historic  movement.  The  others  are  Native
American/American Indian studies, Black/African American studies, Asian American and Pacific Islander studies, and comparative
ethnic studies (sometimes also just called ethnic studies). The four historically defined core disciplines in ethnic studies have also

developed  in  close  relationship  with  other  interdisciplinary  fields  focusing  on  social  justice  and  liberation  through  activism  and
applied scholarship, including women’s studies, queer studies, and whiteness studies, among others.

This chapter is organized into four sections. The first section addresses the definition and purpose of Chicanx and Latinx studies.
The  second  section  addresses  the  historical  roots  of  the  discipline  in  relation  to  ethnic  studies,  how  it  began,  and  how  it  is
expanding.  In  the  third  section,  we  discuss  new  directions  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies,  which  emphasize  the  importance  of
diversity, inclusion, and the need for more equitable representation. In the fourth section, you will learn more about the remainder
of the textbook, Chapters 2 to 10.

Chicanx and Latinx Etymologies

Throughout this textbook, you will have multiple opportunities to learn about and explore key identity terms and labels, such as
Chicanx,  Latinx,  Indigenous  Chicanx/Latinx,  Afro-Latinx,  Chicana/Latina,  and  Jota/o/x,  and  others  beginning  with  Chapter  2:
Identities,  along  with  Chapter  4:  Indigeneities, Chapter  5:  Feminisms,  Chapter  6:  Jotería  Studies,  Chapter  7:  Social  Movement
Activity, and Chapter # 8: Education and Activism. In this chapter, we provide a preliminary set of definitions that are a foundation
for your exploration of the topics, concepts, and content in this textbook.

Chicana, Chicano, and Chicanx are social and political identity terms chosen by people of Mexican heritage living in the United
States  to  signify  their  Indigenous  ancestry  to  the  greater  Southwestern  and  Mesoamerican  (also  called  Anahuac)  regions.  This
identity term emerged as a direct response to the term “Mexican American” to focus greater attention on the political, social, and
cultural position of people of Mexican heritage. Chicana is the feminine form and refers to women and girls, and Chicano is the
masculine form, which refers to men and boys. When the term ends in an ‘x,’ it signifies a non-binary gender, either referring to all
people  regardless  of  gender  or  specifically  referring  to  people  of  non-binary  identities.  Chicana/o/x  is  a  chosen  term,  unlike
Hispanic,  which  became  popularized  and  is  assigned  by  the  United  States  Census  and  other  government  offices  to  emphasize
Spanish influence and Spanish language communities.

Chicana/o/x  is  closely  tied  to  the  terms  Xicana,  Xicano,  and  Xicanx   a  term  which  emphasizes  the  heritage  of  families  whose
homelands in Mexico are tied to the cultural, linguistic, and social practices of Indigenous peoples. The use of the “X” instead of
the “Ch” is to emphasize the spellings and pronunciations used in many Indigenous languages, compared to Spanish and European
languages. Because Chicanx and Xicanx are also political labels, someone may identify as a supporter of the Chicanx community
or the Chicanx movement, even if that is not their heritage. For example, someone born of Ecuadorian parents who grew up in East
Los  Angeles  and  is  regularly  involved  in  community-based  efforts  for  social  justice  may  have  an  enduring  personal  connection
with Chicanx identity and community.

Latina, Latino, and Latinx are used to identify people with ancestry connected to anywhere in Latin America. Latinx differs from
Latina/o as the “x” renders the term gender-neutral and more inclusive. Indigenous Latinx is used to identify Indigenous migrants
from  Latin  America  living  in  the  United  States  who  remain  connected  to  their  Indigenous  languages,  ceremonies,  medicines,
foodways, and ancestral lands. This topic is covered in more depth in Chapter # 4: Indigeneities. Similarly, Afro-Latinx signifies a
Latin  American  person  of  African  heritage,  with  national  or  regional  variations  of  the  term,  such  as  Afro-Mexican  or  Afro-
Brazilian. These identity terms reflect the diverse experiences that Chicanx and Latinx studies attempts to represent and will be
explored in greater detail in Chapter # 2: Identities.

In this book, we pay close attention to the terms and labels used to identify groups of people. The terms Chicanx and Latinx are
used  as  broad  terms  that  include  people  of  all  genders.  Depending  on  the  context,  we  may  refer  to  Chicanx  communities
specifically,  Latinx  communities  in  general,  or  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  as  a  whole  (sometimes  shortened  to
Chicanx/Latinx). Note that Latinx always includes Chicanx, as this is a broader category. In other instances, gendered terms like
Chicana, Chicano, Latina, and Latino are used to refer to gendered communities of people.

## 1.1: Introduction to Chicanx and Latinx Studies

Core Concepts in Chicanx and Latinx Studies

What  is  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  all  about?  Like  the  discipline  of  ethnic  studies,  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  is  about
representing  self  identity,  stories  of  community,  systems  of  oppression,  social  movements,  and  solidarity,  with  the  goal  of
improving  conditions  for  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  and  creating  greater  opportunities  for  leadership  and  self-
determination.  These are referred to as the five S’s as proposed by ethnic studies scholars and teacher-trainers Theresa Montaño
and Allyson Tintiangco-Cubales. In other words, to understand the lived experience of Chicanxs and Latinxs, we must consider in
this  order  the  complexity  of  self  identity  (one's  personal  story  of  their  racialized  intersectional  identity),  stories  of  ancestral
community  (counternarratives  in  the  first  person,  understanding  systems  of  oppression  and  domination,  social  movements  of
resistance to injustice, and solidarity between racialized ethnic groups and allies. One’s identity informs their community’s stories
and vice versa. When systems of oppression have negatively impacted our status (i.e., social, cultural, political, and economic) and
attacked our sense of identity, we can respond by organizing social movements (for example, labor strikes, revolutions, and civil
rights marches). To sustain social movements we can build coalitions with members across marginalized and oppressed groups and
their  allies  to  aid  in  the  resistance  to  forms  of  domination.  The  purpose  of  social  movements  and  solidarity  has  been  to  move
toward  liberation  for  our  communities,  to  generate  a  sense  of  empowerment  and  rehumanization,  and  to  participate  in  a
democratic  multicultural  society.  Throughout  this  textbook,  there  are  examples  of  each  of  the  five  S’s  relative  to  Chicanx  and
Latinx studies.

Chicanx and Latinx studies teaches that some of our familial and community hxstories have been shaped by four major historical
eras including:

1. Indigenous or pre-colonial
2. European colonialism
3. cultural nationalisms, and
4. contemporary era.

Hxstories refers to the collective impact of past events, written from a more gender-inclusive perspective. The “x” is used to disrupt
the often rigid gender binarist approach to telling history. Revolutionary movements take place throughout the four eras and have
included  people  of  all  genders.  Scholars  have  struggled  against  institutional  and  cultural  biases  to  incorporate  diverse  voices  in
Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  in  an  equitable  way.  For  example,  Indigenous  Latinx  peoples  have  consistently  practiced  forms  of
cultural preservation and collective resistance to colonialism. This work has fundamentally shaped the beliefs, values, norms, and
policies that influence our day-to-day lives. However, these voices and perspectives have not always been recognized. Since the
turn of the twenty-first century, Chicanx and Latinx studies scholars have observed a turn toward a hemispheric approach, which
emphasizes  the  overlapping  histories  and  experiences  of  people  in  North  America,  Central  America,  the  Caribbean,  and  South
America. These connections and tensions are explored and addressed as a significant area of inquiry throughout this book.

While Chicanx and Latinx studies directly address complex realities, which include oppression, violence, and inequity, the purpose
is  to  present  a  clear  and  accurate  understanding  of  the  potential  solutions  and  interventions  that  will  advance  equity,  self-
determination, and justice. For many students of Chicanx and Latinx studies, this is a way of learning to “read the world” in order
to become more civically engaged toward a fair, inclusive society where everyone has opportunity and voice.  Learning Chicanx
and Latinx studies inside and outside of classrooms means understanding that society is deeply influenced by structures of power
and  resistance  to  domination,  including  hope  and  self-determination.  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  teaches  the  importance  of
decolonizing our minds and recognizing the many generations of resilient and powerful ancestors and relatives who have supported
us on our journey to becoming educated persons. To explore more about education in the context of Chicanx and Latinx studies,
visit Chapter # 8: Education and Activism.

In this case, being educated means acknowledging that our families and communities hold valuable cultural knowledge of self and
3,4
community, referred to as cultural  funds  of  knowledge and  cultural  wealth, or nuestra herencia  (our  precious  knowledge).
Through  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies,  we  observe  that  the  purpose  of  education  is  for  social  change,  personal  and  social
transformation, and community service.

Chicanx and Latinx studies, like ethnic studies, is a discipline created with the intention of being by and for the community––we
are in but not of the “ivory tower” or academy. As you will learn, Chicanx and Latinx studies rose not from the university but from
community demands and social movements. Today the field’s emphasis is activist scholarship, personal and social transformation,

resistance,  healing,  and  collaboration.  This  includes  the  necessity  of  addressing  both  enduring  and  emergent  collaboration  and
conflicts between groups and among diverse communities. Pan-African studies Professor Melina Abdullah reminds us that Black
studies  is  the  intellectual  arm  of  the  Black  Power  Movement.   Similarly,  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  is  the  intellectual  arm  of
Chicanx  and  Latinx  social  movements,  providing  the  intellectual  tools  for  liberation  and  freedom  for  our  communities,
emphasizing the importance of knowledge generated in our communities.

## 1.2: Struggle and Protest for Chicanx and Latinx Studies

Historical Roots of Ethnic Studies

There is no singular origin of Chicanx/Latinx studies or a set of scholars who wrote the field into existence. But there are traces
of beginnings and aspirations reflected in key documents like the Plan de Santa Bárbara published in 1969 by student activists in
California, the Plan de Aztlán published by student activists at the first Chicano Youth Conference in Denver, Colorado, and the
goals of the first Chicana/o studies programs in California and Puerto Rican (Boricua) studies programs on the East Coast. Civil
rights and labor movements like the United Farm Workers of America, and high school Student Walkouts took place throughout the
Greater Southwestern states before Chicanx studies appeared at colleges and universities. More about the history of Chicanx and
Latinx  studies  will  be  addressed  in  Chapter  3:  History  and  Historiography  and  Chapter  8:  Education  and  Activism.  Scholars
sometimes  associated  with  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  are  Rudy  Acuña,  Sonia  E.  Alvarez,  Gloria  Anzaldúa,  Yarimar  Bonilla,
Antonia  Castañeda,  Teresa  Córdova,  Adelaida  Del  Castillo,  Juan  Flores,  Juan  Gómez-Quiñones,  Elizabeth  “Betita”  Martinez,
Walter  Mingolo,  David  Montejano,  Cherríe  Moraga,  Sylvia  Morales,  Carlos  Muñoz,  Ana  NietoGómez,  Chon  A.  Noriega,  Mary
Pardo, Américo Paredes, Emma Pérez, Beatriz Pesquera, Aníbal Quijano, Adela Sosa Ridell, Mérida M. Rúa, Vicki L. Ruiz, Chela
Sandoval, Rosaura Sanchez, Carmen Teresa Whalen, and Patricia Zavella, among others. While many Chicanx and Latinx studies
intellectuals have worked as activist scholars with formal training, others have developed their scholarship as organic intellectuals,
a concept that refers to individuals who gain advanced expertise through hands-on experience, working directly with community
members. Collectively, this work offers an understanding of the world from the eyes of Chicana/o/xs and Latina/o/xs. Chicanx and
Latinx studies emerged from the struggles and long histories of communities of color and Indigenous peoples who value education
for  its  potential  to  transform  lives,  inspire  change,  raise  awareness,  and  disrupt  systems  of  power  and  exploitation.  But  how  is
Chicanx and Latinx studies connected to ethnic studies?

Ang hindi lumingon sa pinanggalingan ay hindi makakarating sa paroroonan. (A person who does not look back to where he
came from would not be able to reach his destination.) — Proverb by Dr. Jose P. Rizal, National Hero of the Philippines

This proverb is understood by ethnic studies educators to mean, “No history, no self. Know history, know self,” and it reflects Dr.
Jose Rizal’s leadership in the Filipino Revolution against Spanish colonization. Although the statement was made halfway around
the world away from the homelands of Chicanx and Latinx communities, it and the larger struggle for justice and decolonization
resonate with the historical roots of Chicanx and Latinx studies, along with the larger field of ethnic studies. Decolonization refers
to  the  various  struggles  led  by  Indigenous  people  for  land,  sovereignty,  self-determination,  and  a  transformation  of  the  ongoing
conditions of colonial power. Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island (a name for North and Central America used by some Indigenous
peoples  of  the  western  hemisphere)  have  practiced  educational  pedagogies  that  center  reciprocity,  mutual  respect,  and
interdependence long before the creation of Chicanx and Latinx studies as an academic field. Traditional knowledge that has been
sustained and carried forward in the face of settler colonialism provides vital insight into the importance of activism and strategies
of resistance against oppressive systems.  Settler-colonialism refers to the specific forms of colonialism in which outside powers
attempt to eradicate and replace the living societies of Native people to establish and maintain settler societies. Importantly, settler-
colonialism is a structure, not an event. This means that it is an ongoing system like racism and sexism, not a historical moment
that is relegated to the past.

The  introduction  of  colonial  education  led  to  the  attempted  erasure  and  genocide  of  Indigenous  lifeways.  For  example,  the
missions in California, which were first established in 1769, served as central institutions of enslavement and labor for Catholic
priests  to  coerce  Indigenous  peoples  to  adopt  Christianized  belief  systems,  traditions,  and  language.  Missions  disrupted  Native
American families and prevented family formation and transmission of cultural knowledge. Similarly, in 1869 the U.S. government
and  Christian  churches  began  systematically  kidnapping  Native  American  children  and  trafficking  students  into  government  and
church-run boarding schools, which were designed to forcefully strip students of their Native American beliefs and practices by
imposing  the  English  language,  Christian  religious  customs,  and  colonized  modes  of  dress,  effectively  destroying  their  tribal
values, knowledge, and identity.

Throughout  the  19th  and  20th  centuries,  the  United  States  greatly  expanded  the  role  of  public  education  in  daily  life.  This
infrastructure  was  built  up  unequally,  with  schools  actively  segregated  by  race  and  socio-economic  status.  The  separation  of
students by race helped to reinforce the existing racial hierarchy in the broader society, providing legitimacy and justification for
prevailing dominant ideologies. In Chapter # 8: Education and Activism, you will learn more about the history of activist and legal
challenges to segregation and the relationship between this work and the field of Chicanx and Latinx studies. The roots of current-
day ethnic studies are connected to the ongoing resistance to oppressive educational systems such as these.

Early Days: Ethnic Studies, Chicano Studies, and Chicana Studies

Throughout  the  1960s,  colleges,  and  universities  were  the  sites  of  student-led  protests  for  racial  justice,  environmental  justice,
gender liberation, and in opposition to the war in Vietnam. It is in this context that Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale met at Merritt
College  in  Oakland,  California,  where  they  were  inspired  by  the  writings  of  the  Black  Martinican  radical  author  Frantz  Fanon.
They  began  a  student  group  called  Soul  Students  Advisory  Council  and  advocated  for  the  first  Black  studies  program  before
founding the Black Panther Party. At the same time, similar efforts were underway throughout California and across the country.
The Black Student Union at San Francisco State College (SFSC) was started in 1963 by activists who had trained with the Black
Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which included Chicanx students. SNCC was a youth-
led movement in support of racial justice and civil rights that regularly collaborated with other major leaders and groups working
for civil rights and human rights. The organization supported the small minority of Black students at SFSC at the time and sought
to increase enrollment. In 1966, Jimmy Garret from SNCC arrived on campus to mobilize and organize Black students. The earlier
Freedom  Rides  in  1961  and  the  1968  East  L.A.  Walkouts  inspired  many  individuals  to  join  these  movements,  as  they  both
emphasized the importance of access to education in the larger context of racial justice and civil rights.  You will learn more about
this history in the context of education in Chapter # 8: Education and Activism.

At  SFSC,  some  of  the  administration  allowed  students  to  teach  each  other  courses  not  included  in  the  traditional  curriculum
through the Experimental College. Students resisted any attempt to control the content of these courses, including control over who
would  be  the  invited  speakers.  The  culture  and  operations  of  the  Experimental  College  attracted  radicalized  Black  students.
Students, especially leaders in the Black Student Union, used the Experimental College to build the Black studies curriculum. By
1968, the Black studies curriculum covered history, social sciences, and the humanities, including courses like Sociology of Black
Oppression, American Institutions, Culture in Cities, Composition, Modern African Thought and Literature, Recurrent Themes in
Twentieth Century Afroamericano Thought, Creative Writing, Avant-Garde Jazz, Play Writing, and Black Improvisation.

The Longest Student Strike

(cid:0)   Content  Warning:  Physical  Violence.  Please  note  that  this  section  includes  discussion  of  physical  violence,  including  police
violence against people of color.

George Murray was a beloved English instructor at SFSC who was known for his vocal critiques of racism and the Vietnam War.
He also served as the Minister of Education for the Black Panther Party. After he was fired on November 1, 1968, student leaders
from the Black Student Union (BSU) and Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) started a strike. The TWLF was a multi-ethnic
coalition  of  students  that  were  awoken  to  the  fact  that  they  were  being  taught  in  ways  that  were  dominating  and  irrelevant  to
themselves.
 It included a coalition of the BSU, Latin American Student Organization (LASO), Intercollegiate Chinese for Social
Action (ICSA), Mexican American Student Confederation, Philippine (now Pilipino) American Collegiate Endeavor (PACE), La
Raza, Native American Students Union, and Asian American Political Alliance. Supporting this coalition were white students as
well.  These  movements  built  on  intergenerational  traditions  of  protest  and  advocacy  that  informed  the  emergent  groups  that
formed,  established,  and  nurtured  ethnic  studies.
  This  led  to  the  formation  of  a  comprehensive  list  of  demands  to  the
college.
 Penny Nakatsu was one of the strike’s leaders at SFSC. Her speeches emphasized the importance of connecting student
oppression  with  U.S.  imperialism  and  militarism  that  creates  adverse  conditions  throughout  Third  World  countries.  Nesbit
Crutchfield  was  also  a  prominent  leader  in  the  organization  and  the  first  striker  to  be  arrested.  He  spent  over  a  year  in  jail  and
others were jailed too.

Police  officers  used  militarized  tactics  on  strikers,  including  directly  assaulting  students  with  batons,  water  hoses,  and  other
weapons. SFSC’s President at the beginning of the strike, Robert Smith, was sympathetic to students and interested in hearing out
their demands. However, the administration quickly replaced President Smith with Samuel Ichiyé Hayakawa, who represented the
interests  of  the  predominantly  white  California  State  College  Board  of  Trustees,  along  with  then  California  Governor  Ronald
Reagan. The TWLF made a conscious choice in its organizing to center the leadership of students of color. However, the strike also
garnered  support  from  white  students  and  community  members,  as  well  as  the  faculty  union,  a  local  chapter  of  the  American
Federation of Teachers. The strike lasted for nearly five months and at its peak, had halted nearly all classes and college operations.
Although the protestors were met with hostility, resistance, arrests, and violence, they countered this with a strategy called the “War
of  the  Flea,”  which  focused  on  disruptive  tactics  that  would  pressure  the  administration  to  take  action.  For  example,  protestors
checked  out  massive  amounts  of  books  from  the  library,  disrupted  classes  to  encourage  students  to  join  the  strikes,  and  staged
massive public demonstrations with music and chanting.

Outcomes of the Strike

In the end, the strikers won nearly all of their demands, including the creation of a Black studies Department, the funding of 11.3
new  full-time  equivalent  faculty  positions,  a  new  Associate  Director  of  Financial  Aid,  the  creation  of  an  Economic  Opportunity
Program (EOP) with 108 students admitted for Spring 1969 in this program, as well as 500 seats committed for non-white students
in the Fall of 1969 with 400 additional slots for EOP students, and a commitment to creating the School of Ethnic Studies.
 The
School of Ethnic Studies later became San Francisco State University’s College of Ethnic Studies, which includes Africana studies,
American  Indian  studies,  Asian  American  studies,  Latina/Latino  studies,  and  Race  and  Resistance  studies.  The  strikers’  unmet
demands included that Dr. Nathan Hare and George Murray be reinstated as faculty in the newly formed Black studies program.
Despite  these  losses,  to  this  day,  the  strike  remains  the  longest  student  strike  in  U.S.  history  and  is  a  testament  to  the  power  of
student mobilization.

The  tenacity  of  the  strikers  inspired  students  at  the  University  of  California,  Berkeley  (UCB)  to  form  their  own  Third  World
Liberation  Front  in  January  1969,  who  began  a  separate  strike  for  ethnic  studies  at  UCB.
  Strikers  called  for  a  Third  World
College, but the administration ultimately formed a Department of Ethnic Studies. Chicanas/os who were TWLF members included
Lucha Corpi, Larry Trujillo, Francisco Hernandez, and others.

  ethnic  studies  (1968),  and  Chicano  Youth  Conference  (1969).

Throughout the country, racial justice and student activism were front and center, leading to a cascade of activism for ethnic studies
programs,  including  the  core  disciplines  of  Black  studies,  Chicano  studies,  Asian  American  studies,  and  American  Indian  This
momentum  was  built  through  grassroots  movements,  such  as  those  created  by  the  United  Farm  Workers  of  America  (since
1962),
  Building  from  this  work,  Chicana/o/x  activists  came
together at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and published El Plan de Santa Barbara, a document that united
diverse activists from around the state of California and laid out a roadmap for Chicana/Chicano studies. Of equal importance to
new areas of academic scholarship were programs to increase the retention, engagement, and success of students from minoritized
backgrounds. Various chapters of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA, now Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de
Aztlán)  advocated  for  equity  and  justice  in  higher  education,  such  as  the  protestors  in  Figure  1.2.1,  who  are  shown  supporting
Cesar  Chavez  College.  In  response  to  this  type  of  student  activism,  UCSB  created  the  first  Chicano  Studies  Department  in  the
University of California in 1970, now Chicana and Chicano Studies, and eventually formed the first Ph.D. program in the field in
2003.  California  State  University,  Los  Angeles,  was  also  a  forerunner  in  this  area,  establishing  a  Mexican  American  studies
program in 1968, which became the Department of Chicano Studies in 1971, and is now called the Department of Chicana(o) and
Latina(o) Studies.

Growth and Expansion of Chicanx/Latinx Studies

Scholarly Associations and Research

Scholarly  associations  are  voluntary  organizations  of  professional  researchers  who  organize  the  exchange  of  ideas  through
activities like conferences where scholars present and share their work, newsletters, peer-reviewed publications, scholarships, and
research  grants.  Within  Chicanx/Latinx  studies,  multiple  scholarly  organizations  exist  that  focus  on  specific  disciplines  and
populations of scholars.

The  National  Association  for  Chicano  Social  Scientists  was  formed  in  1972  and  renamed  the  National  Association  for  Chicano
Studies in 1973. To recognize the contributions of mujeres (women) it changed its name to the National Association for Chicana
and  Chicano  Studies  (NACCS)  in  1995,  which  remains  the  name  today.  You  can  learn  more  about  this  history  in  Chapter  5:
Feminisms.  To  address  the  diversity  of  identity  politics  and  conditions,  NACCS  created  various  caucus  groups.  They  include
Chicana, Graduate Student, Jotería, Indigenous, Lesbian Bisexual Mujeres Transgender (LBMT), K-12, Student, Community, and
Labor. A sister organization of NACCS that emerged called Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS),  was founded
in  1982.  It  focuses  on  Chicana/Latina  and  Indigenous  feminist  scholarship  separately  from  what  was  known  at  the  time  of  its
founding as the National Association for Chicano Studies (now NACCS). Some MALCS members established the Society for the
Study of Gloria Anzaldúa. Similarly, after years of collective work, organizing, and tension within various caucus groups focused
on  gender  and  sexuality  within  NACCS,  in  2011,  scholars  formed  an  independent  group  called  the  Association  for  Jotería  Arts,
Activism,  and  Scholarship  (AJAAS).This  focuses  on  intersecting  issues  centered  around  sexuality,  gender,  and  power  and  is
discussed  in  more  depth  in  Chapter  6:  Jotería  Studies.  Even  more  recently,  in  2014,  the  Latina/o  Studies  Association  was  also
formed. This group focuses on the global community of scholars in Latina/o/x studies.

Academic associations encourage student participation and have specific opportunities and scholarships available to students in the
field.  There  are  also  associations  within  other  disciplines  that  utilize  a  racial  justice  lens  or  are  focused  on  Chicanx  and  Latinx
communities  such  as  the  Latino  Caucus  of  the  American  Public  Health  Association,  National  Latino  Behavioral  Health
Association, Society  for  Advancement  of  Chicanos/Hispanics  and  Native  Americans  in  Science  (SACNAS),  and  the  American
Sociological Association Section on Latino/a Sociology. Importantly, not all of these organizations and not all groups focused on
Latin American and Latinx origin communities reflect the same values, principles, and methods of Chicanx and Latinx studies. For
example, fields like Latin American studies and Central American studies focus on the distinctive societies, cultures, politics, and
peoples of Latin America and Central America. These areas originally grew out of coordinated political work to counter liberation
and self-determination movements in these regions. However, over time, younger scholars in the field have come to recognize and
collaborate  with  progressive  scholars  and  work  in  the  community.  This  approach  may  appear  in  American  studies  and  cultural
studies, as well as in social sciences and humanities disciplines. This typically does not include a commitment to transformative
social  change  through  engaged  scholarship  and  relevant  pedagogies,  which  is  a  core  principle  of  Chicanx/and  Latinx  studies,  as
well as ethnic studies.

Non-academic  organizations  that  have  been  important  to  the  scholarly  associations  and  social  movements,  civil  rights,  and
development  of  leadership  associated  with  Chicanx  and  Latinx  struggles  have  included  Mexican  American  Legal  Defense  and
Educational Fund (MALDEF), League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), California Latino School Board Association,
California  Latino  Legislative  Caucus,  and  California  Latino  Caucus,  and  the  bi-national  organization  Frente  Indígena  de
Organizaciones Binacionales (FIOB), which serves Indigenous Latinx migrant and non-migrant communities across California and
Mexico. Chicano  Latino  Youth  Leadership  Project  and  Future  Leaders  of  America  are  two  youth-based  organizations  that  have
been involved with the work of Chicanx and Latinx studies.

Growth and Institutionalization

Chicanx and Latinx studies provide an excellent opportunity for students to deepen their knowledge and passion for meaningful
topics related to their lives and communities for the purpose of social change. Research shows that Chicanx/Latinx studies classes,
like other ethnic studies courses, have academic and social benefits for all students, as well as campus communities as a whole.

In  an  urgent  response  to  the  ongoing  miseducation  and  underrepresentation  of  historically  racialially  marginalized  students  in
school  curriculum,  there  have  been  calls  to  mandate  an  ethnic  studies  requirement  in  high  schools  and  colleges.  Legislative
activism is evident in the passage of California Assembly Bill 101 and Assembly Bill 1460, Oregon  House  Bill  2845/2023,  and
Texas House Bill 1504-2021-22.

In California, faculty advocates and administrators established ethnic studies as a general education graduation requirement in
California high schools, the California Community College (CCC), the California State University (CSU), and the University of

California (UC) systems. Assemblymember Shirley Weber, the author of AB 1460, and faculty advocates are displayed in Figure
1.2.2. This bill was passed in 2020 and built on the work of Assemblyman Luis Alejo.

Figure 1.2.2: “Assembly Leader Shirley Weber, Black Lives Matter Leader Melina Abdullah, and Ethnic Studies/Chicanx Studies
Faculty Melissa Moreno” by Melissa Moreno, Author is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

AB 1460 changed the general education curriculum to include ethnic studies as a graduation requirement for all 23 campuses in the
CSU  system,  separate  from  any  diversity  or  multiculturalism  requirements.  The  CSU  enrolls  nearly  half  a  million  students
(485,550 in 2022), and it is the largest public research university system in the world. AB 1460 acknowledges ethnic studies as
made  up  of  distinct  academic  fields,  one  of  which  is  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies.  The  California  Community  College  Ethnic
Studies Faculty Council (CCCESFC) and allies followed their CSU colleagues by advocating for a CCC ethnic studies graduation
requirement, resulting in changing the Title V legislative code. In addition, the UC Ethnic Studies Faculty Council with the system-
wide  Academic  Council  is  in  the  process  of  establishing  both  an  ethnic  studies  graduation  requirement  and  an  admission
requirement for high school students planning to attend the UC.

Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  curriculum  has  a  long  history  in  the  K-12  educational  context  as  well.  In  2014,  El  Rancho  Unified
School District in Pico Rivera, California, created a high school requirement for ethnic studies. The Ethnic Studies Now Coalition
helped  to  spread  the  movement  to  other  high  schools  through  advocacy  and  sharing  resources.  With  more  and  more  districts
adopting ethnic studies, statewide advocates in California moved to formalize the curriculum and establish a framework for ethnic
studies teachers, including Chicanx and Latinx studies. Further, in conjunction with the growth and institutionalization of ethnic
studies,  AB  1703  passed  in  2022  in  California  to  establish  the  California  Indian  Education  Act  and  encourages  school  districts,
county  offices  of  education,  and  charter  schools  to  form  California  Indian  Education  Task  Forces  with  California  tribes  local  to
their  regions  or  tribes  historically  located  in  the  region,  in  order  to  develop  model  curricula  related  to  Native  American  studies.
This legislation is a reminder that ethnic studies cannot, and should not, be taught without advancing the present and past realities
of Native American peoples.

Campus  programs  like  the  UCLA  Center  X  /  Teacher  Education  Program,  Exito  at  UCSB,  and  professional  development
organizations  like  XITO  (Xicanx  Institute  for  Teaching  and  Organizing), Acosta  Educational  Partnership,  and  Liberated  Ethnic
Studies  have  started  to  train  educators  interested  in  working  in  this  growing  field.  Likewise,  Assembly  Bill  1255,  authored  by
Wendy Carrillo, calls for the creation of a statewide task force to provide a report on the creation of a single-subject credential in
ethnic studies because it does not yet exist. Currently, the social science credential does not prepare teachers with the content and
pedagogical  training  needed  to  teach  ethnic  studies.  In  May  2022,  Assemblymember  Jose  Medina  argued  this  very  point  to  the
California  Department  of  Education  teacher  credential  leadership.  To  augment  this  gap  in  California  teacher  credentialing,
educators at Fullerton College have created an Ethnic Studies for Educators certificate program, which is the first of its kind in the
community  college  system  and  will  provide  current  and  future  teachers  with  disciplinary  training  in  ethnic  studies  that  can  be
applied to K-12 teaching.

This moment is an opportunity for educators at all levels to embrace, honor, and respect the contributions and social movements led
by  Latinxs  and  other  communities  of  color  in  the  state  and  nation,  along  with  other  issues  championed  by  diverse  marginalized
groups. Long before the beginning of ethnic studies as a formal discipline in the 1960s, communities have been calling for relevant,
responsive  education  that  communicates  the  truth  of  historical,  political,  social,  and  cultural  systems.  This  has  implications  for

early  childhood  education,  K-12,  and  higher  education.  As  of  the  writing  of  this  book,  these  are  pressing  and  current  political-
educational issues being addressed in California and throughout the country.

Threats Against Chicanx/Latinx Studies

While  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  scholarship  and  curriculum  have  experienced  substantial  growth  over  50  years,  the  field  has
always  been  threatened  by  counter-movements  and  institutional  resistance.  In  1998  in  Tucson,  Arizona,  the  school  district
established a Mexican American studies program that grew to 48 course offerings and was the largest ethnic studies program in any
school  district  nationwide.  The  department  offered  student  support  and  facilitated  teachers’  and  parents’  involvement  in
Chicana/o/x  and  Latina/o/x  student  success,  which  directly  increased  graduation  rates  and  grades  in  all  classes.  In  2010,  state
lawmakers passed Arizona House Bill 2281, which dismantled the program and banned a range of related books from any classes
in the state. In response, activists in Arizona organized a book-ban caravan to California, inspiring California ethnic studies faculty
and  advocates  from  ethnic  studies,  forging  greater  solidarity  across  state  lines.  Figure  1.2.3  shows  protesters  in  June  2011
supporting  the  Tucson  Unified  School  District's  Mexican-American  Studies  program.  This  protest  cultivated  the  will  for  change
and supported activists engaged in drawn-out legal battles over the legislation. Eventually, the ban was overturned in 2017,  as  it
was deemed racist and unconstitutional.

Figure 1.2.3: “Arizona Ethnic Studies” by Arizona Community Press, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0

The anti-ethnic studies rhetoric from the Arizona law, which claimed to restrict teachers from promoting “resentment toward a race
or  class  of  people"  or  advocating  “ethnic  solidarity  instead  of  the  treatment  of  pupils  as  individuals,”  re-emerged  in  2021  as
conservative  activists  strategically  conflated  ethnic  studies  and  Critical  Race  Theory.  They  falsely  made  it  seem  like  they  were
interchangeable.  Critical  Race  Theory  is  a  legal  perspective  that  examines  the  relationship  between  U.S.  laws  and  systemic
racism, with a particular emphasis on how to end racial bias. Ethnic studies, by contrast, is an interdisciplinary field of study that
encompasses  a  wide  range  of  topics,  issues,  and  perspectives  focused  on  the  lived  experiences  of  historically  defined  racialized
groups.  Legislators  have  passed  statewide  bans  on  Critical  Race  Theory  to  intimidate  K-12  educators  who  discuss  race  and
ethnicity in their classrooms in any format, including ethnic studies. Despite this political hostility and counter-mobilization, ethnic
studies educators and others invested in student equity and success continue to work at the front lines to inspire students and ensure
that the next generation has access to a relevant education.

As California continues to formalize and institutionalize ethnic studies, scholars and activists are contending with the boundaries of
the field and its purpose for higher education and society. With the inclusion of ethnic studies in general education requirements,
courses  in  Chicanx/Latinx  studies  will  receive  a  greater  amount  of  institutional  oversight,  and  an  increased  number  of  students
gaining from this content and pedagogy. However, this has created an incentive for faculty from outside disciplines with no training
in  Chicanx/Latinx  studies  or  ongoing  work  in  the  field  to  enter  the  discipline  as  instructors  or  researchers.  While  many  fields
address topics related to ethnicity, race, politics, culture, and society, expertise in the traditions and practices of Chicanx and Latinx
studies is based on disciplinary training and a sustained commitment to racial justice through action.

## 1.3: New Directions in Chicanx and Latinx Studies

Frameworks: Intersectional, Transnational, and Relational

Chicanx and Latinx studies is a dynamic field that has evolved over time. While this field is not constricted to a singular framework
or  paradigm,  it  is  meant  to  be  rooted  in  the  relationship  between  activist  movements  for  racial  justice,  liberation,  and
interdisciplinary academic inquiry. Within the field, multiple marginalized scholars have worked to center the diversity of Chicanxs
and Latinxs, and more work is needed. As discussed in Chapter # 2: Identities, feminist and queer scholars have advocated changing
the  name  from  Chicano  studies,  which  implies  masculinity  and  men’s  concerns  as  the  norm,  to  Chicana  studies,  Chicana  and
Chicano studies, Chican@ studies, Chicanx studies, or other similar labels. These titles signal inclusion and respect for all genders
and people, along with research guided by feminist praxis and jotería studies.

Similarly, Afro-Latinxs and Indigenous Latinx peoples have advocated having an expansive conceptualization of ethnicity and race
that include complicating mestiza/o/x (multi-racial) identities, Indigenous cultures, traditions, tribal affiliation, and sovereignty, and
diverse  experiences  of  colorism,  African/Black  identity,  and  heritage.  With  an  increasing  Central  American  and  Indigenous
population in the United States, more representation of these communities is needed in Chicanx and Latinx studies, exemplified by
the work being done at California State University, Northridge and University of California, Los Angeles in Chicanx and Central
American Studies. With the growing number of Central American students in California, it is critical to also have their family and
community realities represented with social action research. You will have the opportunity to explore specific intersectional topics
further in Chapter # 2: Identities, Chapter # 4: Indigeneities, Chapter # 5: Feminisms, and Chapter  6:  Jotería  Studies.  In  this  book,  we
present  the  field  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  in  a  way  that  is  inclusive  as  possible  of  these  developments.  We  bring  them
together,  along  with  other  relevant  scholarship  in  ethnic  studies,  through  a  framework  that  is  intersectional,  transnational,  and
relational. These frameworks are defined in the remainder of this section and explored in further detail in Chapter 3: History and
Historiography.

This idea is visualized in the artwork presented in Figure 1.3.1, “Somxs Muchxs” (“We are the Many”) by Fernando Martí. The
poster  demonstrates  the  unification  of  many  diverse  activists  around  a  shared  struggle,  and  it  reminds  us  to  consider  the  role  of
collective struggle.

Intersectionality  means  analyzing  the  multiple  identities  and  social  systems  that  influence  and  shape  individuals'  and
communities' experiences, including their relationship to power structures and institutions. In 1990 the term was coined by Black
feminist  legal  scholar  Kimberlé  Crenshaw  and  represents  the  lived  experiences  of  many  women  of  color  feminists  and  many
generations  of  work  that  led  to  this  intellectual  term.
  It  is  a  conceptual  lens  that  allows  for  identifying  the  role  of  gender,
sexuality, immigration status, Indigeneity, socio-economic background, ability status, age, religion, and other factors, in addition to
race and ethnicity. This is also visualized in Figure 1.3.2, with a set of overlapping circles labeled with the numbers 1-12, which are
listed as

1. Race
2. Ethnicity
3. Gender Identity
4. Class
5. Language
6. Religion
7. Ability
8. Sexuality
9. Mental Health

10. Age
11. Education
12. Body Size … and many more …

The  caption  reads,  “Intersectionality  is  a  lens  through  which  you  can  see  where  power  comes  and  collides,  where  it  locks  and
intersects.  It  is  the  acknowledgment  that  everyone  has  their  own  unique  experiences  of  discrimination  and  privilege  -  Kimberle
Crenshaw.”

Recognizing  these  realities  helps  us  more  clearly  understand  how  societal  disparities  are  created  and  affect  different  groups.
Importantly,  they  also  inform  more  effective  interventions,  campaigns,  and  social  movements  that  can  address  longstanding
inequities. Historically, multiple marginalized voices have been excluded from key positions of power and decision-making spaces.
Throughout the textbook, you will find contributions of diverse Latinx scholars guiding the perspectives and examples provided.
Further, we utilize this inclusive approach to shed light on the creative strategies used to combat systemic inequities, racism, and
settler colonialism.

The dynamics of transnational identities, formations, cultures, and politics are vital to the lives and experiences of Chicanxs and
Latinxs. Transnational refers to social dynamics that exist beyond an individual community and nation-state. This deconstructs the
importance  of  existing  nations,  borders,  and  paradigms  of  citizenship,  instead  focusing  on  how  culture,  society,  and  human  life
communicate identity and move across lands. Unlike international, global, or multinational, transnational focuses on ideas, activist

campaigns, and solidarity efforts transcending nationalistic and colonial borders. Examining transnational dynamics allows us to
explore the lives and cultures of migrant people and transnational families and communities.

Finally, our use of a relational framework draws from ethnic studies and Chicanx/Latinx studies to include both specific and broad
perspectives  that  draw  from  diverse  experiences  and  voices,  described  in  detail  in  Chapter  3:  History  and  Historiography.  This
affirms intersectional and transnational approaches, which make space for the diversity of what it means to be Chicanx and Latinx.
It  also  extends  our  analysis  to  include  tools,  examples,  and  scholarship  from  other  ethnic  studies  fields.  As  discussed  in  the
previous  section,  Chicanx  studies  emerged  as  part  of  the  movement  for  ethnic  studies.  By  attending  to  the  experiences  and
perspectives of minoritized groups, we gain a depth of understanding of the dynamics of race, racialization, and Indigeneity, along
with the strategies used to dismantle white supremacy, cisheteropatriarchy, and settler colonialism.

## 1.4: Overview of the Textbook

Chapter Organization

This  textbook  includes  ten  chapters  representing  cultural  knowledge,  lived  experiences,  key  debates,  paradigms,  frameworks,
theories, concepts, terms, and analytical tools from the discipline of Chicanx and Latinx studies. All are presented for the purpose
of understanding the past to know the present and make a difference in the future. While we encourage you to utilize the textbook
order in whatever order makes the most sense to your course and your own interests, the chapters can be divided into three parts.

Part 1: Foundations and New Directions

The first portion of the book, including this chapter by Melissa Moreno and Mario Alberto Viveros Espinoza-Kulick, along with
Chapter # 2: Identities and Chapter # 3: History and Historiography by Amber Rose González provide a foundation for understanding
the  social,  political,  and  historical  processes  of  identity  formation  and  the  importance  of  community  stories  in  the  context  of
Chicanx and Latinx studies.

Identity formation has been shaped by resistance movements for self-determination against systems of oppression to empower and
rehumanize  marginalized  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities.  Chapter  2:  Identities  discusses  identity  as  socially  constructed  and
embedded  in  a  system  of  power  and  resistance.  It  outlines  important  identity  labels  and  when  and  why  they  emerged.  Chapter
2 also provides an examination of the current demographics that make up Chicanx and Latinx communities. Chapter 3: History and
Historiography focuses on the purpose and meaning of history, and the various approaches, methods, and frameworks that can be
used  to  study  history  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities.  González  advances  how  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  serves  as  an
intervention  to  the  discipline  of  history  and  highlights  the  contributions  of  feminist  and  queer  studies  scholars  in  the  field  of
Chicanx and Latinx history.

Part 2: Chicanx and Latinx Intersectionalities

The  next  portion  of  the  book  extends  these  perspectives  by  focusing  on  the  intersection  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx  identities  with
Indigeneity,  gender,  and  sexuality.  Chapter  4:  Indigeneities  by  Mario  Alberto  Viveros  Espinoza-Kulick  and  Melissa
Moreno, Chapter # 5: Feminisms by Amber Rose González, and Chapter # 6: Jotería Studies by Eddy Francisco Alvarez Jr. are focused
on  critical  and  intersectional  perspectives,  demonstrating  how  Indigeneity,  language,  citizenship,  and  sexuality  are  subjectivities
that impact the social status and lived experiences of members of Chicanx and Latinx communities.

Chapter  4:  Indigeneities  provides  an  overview  of  terminology  associated  with  Indigeneity,  Indigenous  demographics  in  Latin
America  and  México,  and  how  peoples  in  the  past  and  present  have  expressed  their  Indigenous  identities.  Chapter  5:
Feminisms  offers  a  genealogy  of  the  emergence  of  Chicana  and  Latina  feminisms  including  critical  issues  and  key  areas  of
activism. Chapter 6 provides an introduction to the emergence of jotería studies and the importance of self-naming, highlighting
some of the cultural and scholarly activist contributions that this area of study has made in Chicanx and Latinx studies. This chapter
also  explores  self-determination  in  queer  and  trans  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  safety  and
healing spaces.

Part 3: Activism, Praxis, and Culture

The remaining four chapters build on these perspectives by exploring the social, political, and cultural dynamics impacting Chicanx
and Latinx communities in the context of activism, education, health, and culture. Chapter # 7: Social Movement Activity by Mario
Alberto  Viveros  Espinoza-Kulick,  Chapter  8:  Education  and  Activism  by  Lucha  Arévalo,  Chapter  9:  Health  by  Mario  Alberto
Viveros Espinoza-Kulick and Melissa Moreno, and Chapter # 10: Cultural Productions by Mario Alberto Viveros Espinoza-Kulick
all reflect on Chicanx and Latinx studies in social and political action.

Chapter  7:  Social  Movement  Activity  focuses  on  20th  and  21st-century  social  and  political  movements.  The  chapter  presents
frameworks  to  assess  resistance,  racial  and  social  justice,  and  solidarity  among  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities.  Chapter  7
also  identifies  how  Chicanx  and  Latinx  organizations  have  enacted  equity,  self-determination,  liberation,  and  anti-racism.  It
highlights  intersectional  Chicanx  and  Latinx  movements  that  address  issues  related  to  class,  gender,  sexuality,  national  origin,
immigration status, and language. Chapter # 8: Education and Activism examines historical educational policies and legal cases used
for  social  change,  providing  concepts  to  critically  understand  key  historical  education  debates,  issues,  and  initiatives  that
impact Chicanx and Latinx communities today.

Chapter  9:  Health  centers  issues  surrounding  institutional  and  traditional  health,  healing,  and  well-being  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx
communities. This chapter identifies health conditions, public health disparities, behaviors, and outcomes of health influenced by
the  intersection  of  race  and  environmental  racism  as  they  relate  to  class,  gender,  sexuality,  religion,  spirituality,  national  origin,
immigration status, ability, language, and age in Chicanx and Latinx communities. Chapter  10:  Cultural  Productions  delves  into
concepts  such  as  pop  culture  analysis,  encoding,  decoding,  stereotypes,  controlling  images,  tropicalism,  disidentification,
nationalism,  image  analysis,  and  artivism  in  the  context  of  media  and  cultural  productions.  This  chapter  unpacks  how
representations  and  cultural  meaning-making  operate  at  the  intersection  of  race  and  racism  with  class,  gender,  sexuality,
immigration status, ability, and Indigeneity in Chicanx and Latinx communities.

Overall, the chapters are intended to offer readers an introduction to Chicanx/Latinx self identity, stories of community, systems of
oppression, social movements, and solidarity efforts.

## 1.5: Conclusion

Summary

In this introductory chapter, you had the opportunity to learn about the foundations of Chicanx and Latinx studies, including the
historical,  cultural,  and  institutional  background  and  contexts  of  the  discipline.  In  addition,  we  introduced  some  key  concepts,
labels, and perspectives that will be further developed throughout this book. We hope this book provides an entry point into the
significant and timely issues that affect our communities today and the opportunities available for future generations.

Ancillary materials for this chapter are located in Section ## 11.1: Chapter 1 Resource Guide, which includes slides, media, writing
and discussion prompts, and suggested assignments and activities.

Key Terms

Chicanx and Latinx studies: A discipline that has worked for over fifty years to provide a more accurate understanding of the
political,  cultural,  historical,  and  social  contexts  that  shape  our  current-day  experiences  of  race,  identity,  community,  and  the
disparities that plague our society.

Open Educational Resources (OER): Instructional materials that are designed to be freely used, shared, and adapted.

Chicana, Chicano, and Chicanx: Social and political identity terms chosen by people of Mexican heritage living in the United
States  to  signify  their  Indigenous  ancestry  to  the  greater  Southwestern  and  Mesoamerican  (also  called  Anahuac)  regions.  This
identity term emerged as a direct response to the term “Mexican American” to focus greater attention on the political, social, and
cultural position of people of Mexican heritage. When the term ends in an ‘x,’ it signifies a non-binary gender, either referring to all
people regardless of gender or specifically referring to people of non-binary identities.

Chicana: The feminine form of Chicana, Chicano, and Chicanx and refers to women and girls, and Chicano is the masculine form,
which refers to men and boys.

Hispanic A term that became popularized and is assigned by the United States Census and other government offices to emphasize
Spanish influence.

Xicana, Xicano, and Xicanx: Those whose families originate from the homeland of [Me]xicana/os and Indigenous people.

Latina, Latino, and Latinx: People with ancestry connected to anywhere in Latin America. Latinx differs from Latina/o as the “x”
renders the term gender-neutral and more inclusive.

Indigenous Latinx: Indigenous migrants from Latin America living in the United States who practice their Indigenous languages,
ceremonies, medicines, foodways, and ancestral lands.

Afro-Latinx: People of African and Latin American heritage, and corresponds to national or regional variations of the term, such
as Afro-Mexican or Afro-Brazilian.

Rehumanization: Conscious work done to combat systemic oppression so that people can participate in a civic society towards
democracy in a multicultural society.

Hxstories: The collective impact of past events, avoiding the andro-centric and colonial association with the term history.

Cultural  funds  of  knowledge and cultural wealth: Assets,  information,  wisdom,  and  expertise  that  exists  within  communities
that have been neglected and disregarded by institutional systems of knowledge production.

Organic intellectuals:  Individuals  who  gain  advanced  expertise  through  direct  experience,  working  with  community  members
directly, and engaging in hands-on work.

Decolonization: The diverse struggles led by Indigenous people for sovereignty, self-determination, and a transformation of the
ongoing conditions of colonial power.

Traditional  knowledge:  Forms  of  knowledge  practiced  by  Indigenous  groups  provide  both  content  expertise  and  communicate
lifeways and intergenerational transfers of information and guided inquiry.

Settler-colonialism: Specific forms of colonialism in which outside powers attempt to eradicate and replace the living societies of
Native people to establish and maintain settler societies.

Colonial  education:  Settler  institutions  that  have  attempted  erasure  and  genocide  of  Indigenous  lifeways,  including  the
government and Church-run Boarding Schools in the United States and Canada.

Third World Liberation Front (TWLF): A multi-ethnic coalition of students that were awoken to the fact that they were being
taught  in  ways  that  were  dominating  and  irrelevant  to  themselves  (Maeda,  2012),  and  included  a  coalition  of  the  Black  Student
Union (BSU), Latin American Student Organization (LASO), Intercollegiate Chinese for Social Action (ICSA), Mexican American
Student  Confederation,  Philippine  (now  Pilipino)  American  Collegiate  Endeavor  (PACE),  La  Raza,  Native  American  Students

El Plan de Santa Barbara: A document that united diverse activists from around the state of California and laid out a roadmap for
Chicana/Chicano  studies,  as  well  as  programs  to  increase  the  retention,  engagement,  and  success  of  students  from  minoritized
backgrounds.

Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MEChA, formerly Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán):  A national student
organization with local chapters that advocate for equity and justice in higher education

General education graduation requirement: A type of course that all students are required to take as part of their educational
requirements to earn a degree. In California, Ethnic studies has become a general education graduation requirement in all public
high schools and colleges.

Critical  Race  Theory:  A  legal  perspective  put  forward  by  scholars  to  identify  the  link  between  U.S.  laws  and  the  structure  of
racism,  with  the  goal  of  better  ending  racial  discrimination  and  disparities.  This  perspective  has  been  misrepresented  by
conservative activists.

Intersectionality: A  concept  that  emphasizes  the  importance  of  recognizing  multiple  identities  when  analyzing  an  individual  or
group’s relationship to societal power structures and institutions.

Transnational: Social dynamics that exist beyond an individual community and nation-state. This deconstructs the importance of
existing nations, borders, and paradigms of citizenship and instead focuses on how culture, society, and human life communicates
identity and moves across lands.

Relational  approaches:  Frameworks  that  utilize  dynamic  comparisons  between  groups  to  yield  greater  knowledge,  encourage
solidarity, and find creative solutions to systemic problems.

Glossary of Ethnic Studies Terms

The  following  list  of  terms  was  adapted  from  the  Liberated  Ethnic  Studies  Model  Curriculum.
  Many  of  these  terms  are  used
throughout the book to demonstrate the methods, analysis, and content in Chicanx and Latinx Studies. This glossary is provided as
a supplemental resource for learners to have more opportunities to develop confidence and understanding of the material.

Activism: Informed action or involvement as a means of achieving a political goal. Activism can manifest in the form of protests,
demonstrations  and  direct  actions,  art  and  cultural  production,  lobbying,  and  advocacy  work,  fundraising,  writing,  educational
discussions, and more.

Agency: The capacity of an individual to act freely and make independent choices in any given environment.

Accompliceship: The process of building relationships grounded in trust and accountability with marginalized people and groups.
Being an accomplice involves attacking oppressive structures and ideas by using one’s privilege and giving up power and position
in  solidarity  with  those  on  the  social,  political,  religious,  and  economic  margins  of  society.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  contested
notion of allyship which is often performative, superficial, and disconnected from the struggles for justice .

Cisheteropatriarchy: A system of society in which cisgender people, men and heterosexuals (especially cisgender heterosexual
men) are privileged, dominant, and hold power. Cisgender refers to people whose gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at
birth, and is the opposite of transgender.

Citizenship: A status granted to a person that has been recognized by a particular country as being afforded all the benefits, rights,
freedoms, and access as a member or citizen of the country. Citizenship is also the relationship a person maintains with the country
or state they are loyal to. Thus, citizenship also includes how citizens engage their communities through both political and non-
political processes for the betterment of their community, state, and nation.

Class: A category and identifier that denotes a person or group’s economic or social status.

Classism: The systematic oppression of subordinated class groups to advantage and strengthen the dominant class groups.

Colonialism:  A  practice  of  domination  whereby  one  country  seizes  control  over  another  country  or  territory  and  its  people  via
force, exploitation, and/or political control.

Community: A  social  group  of  any  size  whose  members  either  reside  in  a  specific  locality,  share  government,  and/or  have  a
common cultural background, struggles, views, or history.

Culture:  The  characteristics,  creations,  and  knowledge  of  a  particular  group  of  people,  place,  or  time.  These  characteristics
include, but are not limited to, beliefs, customs, art, music, language, traditions, and religion.

Dehumanization:  When  a  person  or  group  of  people  are  deprived  of  human  qualities.  This  process  is  often  carried  out  when  a
dominant group abuses power and denies opportunities and rights from another group.

Eurocentric/Eurocentrism:  A  worldview  that  privileges  and  centers  the  thoughts,  practices,  knowledge,  history,  systems  of
beliefs, and customs of the western world and people of western European descent more specifically.

Federal recognition: A status granted to Native American tribes that have gone through the process of being recognized by the
U.S. federal government and have been granted sovereignty. There are over 300 federally recognized tribes across the U.S.

Gender: Western culture has come to view gender as a binary concept, with two rigidly fixed options— men and women. Instead
of  the  static  binary  model  produced  through  a  solely  physical  understanding  of  gender,  a  far  richer  tapestry  of  biology,  gender
expression, and gender identity intersect resulting in a multidimensional array of possibilities. Thus, gender can also be recognized
as a spectrum that is inclusive of various gender identities.

Hegemony: The dominance or influence of one group over another, often supported by legitimating norms and ideas. Hegemony
describes the dominant position of a particular set of ideas and their tendency to become commonsensical and intuitive, thereby
inhibiting the dissemination or even the articulation of alternative ideas.

History,  Herstory,  and  Hxrstory:  History  is  the  study  of  the  past,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  events,  people,  cultures,  art,
languages, foreign affairs, and laws. Herstory is a term used to describe history written from a feminist or women’s perspective.
Herstory is also deployed when referring to counter narratives within history. The prefix “her” instead of “his” is used to disrupt the
often  androcentric  nature  of  history. Hxrstory  is  pronounced  the  same  as  “herstory”  and  describes  history  written  from  a  more
gender inclusive perspective. The “x” is used to disrupt the often rigid gender binarist approach to telling history.

Identity:  The  qualities,  expressions,  beliefs,  physical  traits,  cultures,  and  social  statuses  that  comprise  a  person  and/or  group  of
people.

Ideology:  A  system  of  social,  political,  economic,  and/or  psychological  beliefs,  values,  and  ideals  that  characterize  a  particular
culture, school of thought, organization, or people.

Imperialism:  The  extension  of  one  nation’s  dominance,  power,  or  rule  over  another  via  policy,  ideology,  influence  (social,
economic, religious, etc.), or military.

LGBTQIA2S+: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or questioning, intersex, asexual and/or ally, Two-Spirit. The plus
signals “and other similar identities,” recognizing that sexual and gender diversity extends far beyond any simple list.

Liberating: The state of freedom. Within the context of ethnic studies, liberation is often used to describe social movements whose
aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice.

Migration: The movement of people, voluntarily or involuntarily, from one region to another.

Oppression:  Prolonged  unjust  and/or  cruel  exercise  of  authority  or  power  over  another  person  or  group.  Also,  a  sense  of  being
weighed down in body, mind, or spirit. The four “I”s of oppression are: ideological oppression (an idea, concept, or theory whose
qualities advocate for or can be interpreted as causing harm or upholding the views of a dominant group at the expense of others),
institutional oppression (the belief that one group is superior to another and that the more dominant group should determine when
and  how  those  on  the  margins  are  incorporated  into  institutions  within  a  society),  interpersonal  oppression  (how  oppression  is
played out between individuals), and internalized oppression (the internalization of the belief that one group is superior to another)

People of color; Black, Indigenous and People of Color: People  of  color  refers  to  communities  who  are  not  white.  People  of
color  as  a  collective  identity  emerged  as  a  response  to  systemic  racism  and  to  assert  resistance  and  solidarity  against  white
supremacy. People of color are a global majority. While Indigneous people are often in solidarity with people of color against white
supremacy, the term “Indigenous” and/or “Native American,” or “American Indian” are included separately from people of color.
This draws attention to the unique forms of colonial domination that intersect with racial oppression. Further, Black is often placed

first in the phrase “Black, Indigeinous, and People of Color,” or BIPOC, which draws attention to anti-Blackness as a unique form
of racism and centers Black experiences among minoritized populations.

Power:  The  ability  or  capacity  to  direct,  influence,  or  determine  behavior  (social,  political,  economic,  etc.)  via  authority  and
control.

Privilege: An unearned advantage or benefit not enjoyed by everyone. Within systems of power, privilege is often inherited and is
informed by one’s identity.

Race: A social construct created by European and American pseudo-scientists which sorts people by phenotype into global, social,
and political hierarchies.

Racism: The belief in the superiority of one race over another. Racism manifests when power is used to deny access, rights, and/or
opportunities to a particular group or person based on their racial background.

Resilience: The ability to recover and/or adapt in the face of extreme adversity, trauma, stress, and difficulty.

Self-determination: The process by which a person establishes agency and motivation with the hope of controlling their own life.

Social justice: The equitable distribution of resources (rights, money, food, housing, education, etc.) to every individual regardless
of ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, or nationality.

Solidarity: Unity or agreement of feeling or action, especially among individuals with a common interest; mutual support within a
group.

Whiteness: A social construct that has served as the foundation for racialization in the United States. Whiteness is the antithesis of
Blackness and is commonly associated with those that identify as white. However, Whiteness is much more than a racial identity
marker, it separates those that are privileged from those that are not. Whiteness can manifest as a social, economic, political, and
cultural behavior and power. For example, the “standard” or cultural “norm” are often always based on whiteness and by extension
white culture, norms, and values.

White supremacy: The belief that white people are inherently superior and represent the dominant race. It is an operationalized
form of racism that manifests globally, institutionally, and through systems of power.

Xenophobia: Prejudice and hatred, drawn from irrational fear, against people from a different country.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 2: Identities

 Learning Objectives

Outline contemporary Chicanx and Latinx demographics and the factors that impact them.
Evaluate the historical, political, and social processes that have shaped the racialization of Chicanxs and Latinxs.
Summarize Chicanx/Latinx studies identity concepts, theories, and frameworks.

Introduction

What  does  it  mean  to  be  Latina/o/x/e  and  who  gets  to  decide?  What  do  the  different  word-endings––Latina,  Latino,  Latina/o,
Latin@, Latinx, and Latine––mean? What is the difference between Latinx and Hispanic? Where did these labels come from? Is
Latinx a race or an ethnicity? This chapter tackles these difficult questions and more in order to provide a general overview of the
historical and contemporary meanings of Latinx identities to establish a foundation for understanding the communities that are the
central focus of this book.

The labels that an individual uses to name their race, ethnicity, and other social identities is a personal choice, one that relies on
shared understandings, imagined and/or real, of what it means to belong to that group. These meanings are socially constructed,
that is, they are contextual and change over time and place as a result of social, political, and historical processes. While a person
can choose to identify a particular way internally, they may also be identified externally by other people (usually arbitrarily based
on phenotype and physiognomy), and by federal, state, and private agencies and organizations that collect demographic data such
as the U.S. Census, the Department of Motor Vehicles, schools, universities, employers, and hospitals. The categories and labels
assigned by these various entities may be at odds with or even contradict a person’s self-identification. Put another way, “social
identity is regarded as a constellation of different and often competing identifications or ‘cultural negotiations.’”

In addition to examining race and ethnicity and how these social identities pertain to Latinxs, Chicanx and Latinx studies in general
and this chapter, in particular, are concerned with the ways power structures (ideologies, discourses, institutions, systems) shape
particular  subject  positions,  experiences,  access  to  resources,  and  life  outcomes  for  Latinxs  and  how  these  vary  based  on  the
intersecting  dynamics  of  gender,  sexuality,  class,  language,  religion,  nationality,  tribal  affiliation,  and  immigration  status.  This
mode  of  analysis––developed  by  feminists  of  color  and  popularized  as  intersectionality  in  the  1980s––is  examined  in  detail  in
Chapter # 5: Feminisms and illustrated in Figure 2.1 as a “Wheel of Power/Privilege.” This chapter investigates the ways privilege
was cemented for a select few through the creation and maintenance of hierarchical identity categories across time and place and
the ways that marginalized communities have resisted their oppressors' classifications.

## 2.1: Defining Latinx Demographics

The Influence and Impact of the U.S. Census

This section provides a demographic portrait of Latinxs in the U.S. as defined by the U.S. Census. It also illustrates some of the
tensions between how Latinxs identify and the ways the Census categorizes and counts peoples of Latinx origins, both historically
and in the present. According to the Pew Research Center, the U.S. Hispanic population totaled 62.5 million in 2021, making up
nearly one-in-five people in the U.S., up from 50.5 million in 2010.  People of Mexican origin accounted for nearly 60% (about
37.2  million  people)  of  the  total  Hispanic  population,  however,  their  numbers  increased  by  only  13%  from  2010  to  2021,  the
smallest rate of increase among the largest Hispanic groups. Puerto Ricans, the second largest group, make up 9.3% of the Hispanic
population  with  5.8  million  people  on  the  mainland  and  another  3.1  million  on  the  island.  Salvadorans,  Cubans,  Dominicans,
Guatemalans, Colombians, and Hondurans are the next largest groups, each comprised of one million or more people. Those with
origins in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Guatemala experienced the fastest population growth from 2010 to
2021.  These numbers are reflected in Table 2.1.1.

California is the state with the largest Hispanic population in the United States.  Hispanics became the largest racial or ethnic group
in the state in 2014, surpassing the non-Hispanic white population, whose numbers have been on the decline, reflecting a broader
national trend.  In 2021 there were about 15.8 million Hispanics in California, accounting for 40% of the total population, which
was up from 14.0 million in 2010. Figure 2.1.1 displays the numbers of Latinos in each of the 50 states, with Texas at more than 10
million, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Florida, New York, and others reporting 1 to 10 million, Oregon, Nevada,
Michigan, and others reporting 500,000 to 1 million, Utah, Idaho, and many states in the South and Midwest reporting 100,000 to
149,000, and North and South Dakota, Maine, Vermont, and others reporting less than 100,000.

D.C. (September 22, 2022). Permissions: Pew Research Center Terms of Use

The demographic information that follows is largely based on data gathered by The United States Census Bureau (USCB) through
their  decennial  census.  To  determine  the  racial  and  ethnic  composition  of  the  nation  in  2020,  the  census  included  two  separate
questions––one for Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin and one for race. According to USCB, Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin is
defined as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of
race.  In other words, USCB does not consider Hispanic or Latino to be a race, asserting that the categories “generally reflected
social definitions in the U.S. and were not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. We recognize
that the race categories include racial and national origins and sociocultural groups.”  In 2020 the census options for race included

White,  Black  or  African  American,  American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native,  Asian,  Native  Hawaiian  and  Pacific  Islander,  and  Some
Other Race.  All census respondents, including those who check Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin, are given the option to select
one or more races to define themselves.

 Pause and Reflect: How do You Identify?

Figure 2.1.2 features two census questions used to ask about race and ethnicity. Number 6 asks “Are you of Hispanic, Latino,
or Spanish origin?” The options for responses are:

No, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin
Yes, Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano
Yes, Puerto Rican
Yes, Cuban
Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin – Print, for example, Salvadoran, Dominican, Colombian, Guatemalan,
Spaniard, Ecuadorian, etc.

Question  7  asks  “What  is  your  race?”  with  options  to  mark  one  or  more  boxes  to  identify  your  race  and  to  fill  in  origin
information within each category. The options for responses are:

White – Print, for example, German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, Egyptian, etc.
Black or African Am. – Print for example, African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian, Ethiopian, Somali, etc.
American Indian or Alaska Native – Print name of enrolled or principal tribe(s), for example, Navajo Nation, Blackfeet
Tribe, Mayan, Aztec, Native Village of Barrow inupiaq Traditional Government, Nome Eskimo Community, etc.
Chinese
Vietnamese
Native Hawaiian
Filipino
Korean
Samoan
Asian Indian
Japanese
Chamorro
Other Asian – Print, for example, Pakistani, Cambodian, Hmong, etc.
Other Pacific Islander – Print, for example, Tongan, Fijian, Marshallese, etc.
Some other race – Print race or origin.

Take  a  few  moments  to  review  and  respond  to  questions  6  and  7.  When  you  are  finished,  think  about  why  you  made  the
selections  you  did.  Do  the  options  provided  reflect  how  you  self-identify?  Would  you  change  anything  about  the
categorizations or the labels? How does this form compare to others that have asked for your race and ethnicity, such as school
documents, employment applications, and medical forms?

Figure 2.1.2: “How  the  2020  census  asked  about  Hispanic  origin  and  race,” Pew  Research  Center,  Washington  D.C.  (May  13,
2021). Permissions: Pew Research Center Terms of Use.

The results of the 2020 census indicated that 15.1% of the total population (about 49.9 million people) selected the Some Other
Race box alone or in combination, making it the second-largest race group. Interestingly,

[a]pproximately  45.3  million  people  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  origin  were  classified  as  Some  Other  Race  either  alone  or  in
combination,  compared  with  only  4.6  million  people  who  were  not  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  origin.  Nearly  all  of  those  who
were classified as Some Other Race alone were of Hispanic or Latino origin (26.2 million out of 27.9 million, or 93.9%).

According  to  USCB,  “many  Hispanic  or  Latino  respondents  answered  the  separate  question  on  race  by  reporting  their  race  as
 Moreover, “[t]he number of Latinos
‘Mexican,’ ‘Hispanic,’ ‘Latin American,’ ‘Puerto Rican,’ etc.,” similar to the 2010 Census.
who say they are multiracial has increased dramatically. Almost 28 million Latinos identified with more than one race in 2020, up
from just 3 million in 2010.”  A January 2020 Pew Research Center survey revealed that “only about half of Americans said the
census  reflects  how  they  see  their  own  race  and  origin  ‘very  well.’”  When  comparing  Hispanic,  Black,  and  white  respondents,

Hispanics  were  more  likely  to  say  the  questions  described  them  “not  too  well”  or  “not  well  at  all,”  suggesting  they  found  the
categories as not providing relevant options.
 In fact, a 2015 Pew Research Center survey found “…for two-thirds of Hispanics,
their Hispanic background is a part of their racial background––not something separate. This suggests that Hispanics have a unique
view of race that doesn’t necessarily fit within the official U.S. definitions.”

Many people are confused by or dissatisfied with the census race and ethnicity questions, which have been solicited since the first
census in 1790. This can be attributed to, at least in part, the questions, categories, and labels changing from one decade to the next,
reflecting current politics, scholarship, public attitudes, cultural norms, and community advocacy, demonstrating the malleability of
race in the U.S. Figure 2.1.3 displays the different race, ethnicity, and origin categories used in the census from 1790 to 2020 and
the subsequent list points to the changing ways Hispanics have been identified over the years. It should be noted that “[t]hrough
1950, census-takers commonly determined the race of the people they counted. From 1960 on, Americans could choose their own
race.”

The text in Figure 2.1.3 reads, “This graphic displays the different race, ethnicity, and origin categories used in the U.S. decennial
census, from the first one in 1790 to the latest count in 2020. The category names often changed from one decade to the next, in a
reflection of the current politics, science, and public attitudes. For example, “colored” became “black,” with “Negro” and “African
American” added later and Starting in 2000, Americans could include themselves in more than one racial category. Before that,
many multiracial people were counted in only one racial category.”

The timeline from 1790 to 2020 shows the ten-year cycle of Census dates and includes seven layers corresponding to six racial
categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Pacific Islander, and some other race),
and one ethnic category (Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin). The categories in each group are listed here by the year they were
first collected, with a note if they replaced a previously used category or were newly added.

White: First included in 1790 as “Free white males, Free white males,” replaced in 1850 with “White” until the present.
Black or African American: First included in 1790 as “All other free persons” and “Slaves,” which was replaced in 1820 with
“Free colored males and females” and “Slaves.” In 1850, all categories were replaced with “Black,” “Mulatto,” “Black Slaves,”
and “Mulatto Slaves.” In 1870, both categories of enslaved people were removed, and enslaved people were accounted with
other free Black and multiracial individuals categorized at the time as “Mulatto.” In 1890, “Quadroon” and “Octoroon” were
added. In 1900, the previous categories were replaced with “Black (Negro of Negro descent),” which was replaced in 1910 with

“Black” and “Mulatto.” Since 1930, a single category has been used, starting with “Negro,” until it changed to “Negro or
Black” in 1970, then “Black or Negro” in 1980 until 2000, when it became “Black African American, or Negro” and then
“Black or African American” in 2020.

“Mulatto: Definitions varied from census to census, but this term generally means someone who is black and at least one
other race. Mulattoes, octoroons, and quadroons were counted as single-race black, but today could be counted as
multiracial.”
“Quadroon: Someone with ‘one-fourth black blood,’ according to census-taker instructions.”
“Octoroon: Someone with ‘one-eighth or any trace of black blood.’”

American Indian or Alaska Native: The first category added on the Census beyond Black and white was “Indian” in 1860.
“Although American Indians living in white society were included in the census before 1890, the 1890 census was the first to
include a complete count of American Indians on tribal land as well.” In 1860 the Census began by asking about “Indian”
identity, which continued until 1950 when it was changed to “American Indian.” In 1960, separate categories were added for
Aleut and Eskimo. “Aleut: People who trace their ancestry to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.” In 1970, all three categories were
replaced with “Indian (American)” and in 1980, Aluet and Eskimo were re-added. In 2000, these categories were combined into
American Indian or Alaska Native.
Asian: In 1870, the Census started counting Asian ancestry using the “Chinese” category. In 1890, Japanese was added,
followed by “Other” in 1910. “In 1910, the vast majority of the Other category were Korean, Filipino and Asian Indian (called
Hindu).” These groups were added in 1920. As an imposed term, “Hindu: Referred to Asian Indians, regardless of religion.” In
1950, Korean and Hindu were removed from the options, leaving Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino. In 1960, the survey added
Part Hawaiian and Hawaiian. “Pacific Islanders and Hawaiians were grouped with Asians from 1960-1990. Starting with the
2000 census, they became their own group.” In 1970, the Census re-added Korean, and in 1980 added “Asian Indian” (formerly
labeled “Hindu”) and also added for the first time Vietnamese, Samoan, and Guamanian. In 1990, “Other Asian or Pacific
Islander” was included as an option. For the next census, because Asian and Pacific Islander categories were separated, this
category became “Other Asian.”
Pacific Islander: Three groups, Hawaiian, Samoan, and Guamanian were originally included with the “Asian” categories. In
2000, these were recognized as “Pacific Islander,” Guamanian was changed to “Guamanian or Chamorro” and the option
“Other Pacific Islander” was included. In 2020, Guamanian and Chamorro were separated.
Other: The “Other” option was first included in 1910 and largely referred to people of Asian heritage. With the inclusion of
other groups, this category came to include people of smaller groups and people of multiracial backgrounds who do not want to
select just one race (until 2000 when the option to select multiple categories was added). Other was included until 1960 and
then re-added in 1970. In 1990 the label was changed to “Other race” and in 2000 updated to “Some other race.”

The events summarized in the section on Hispanic, Latino, and Spanish origin ethnicity are detailed in the following section.

The image also includes a rendering of a historical Census count from South Carolina with each group tabulated by state in hand-
printed script. This is accompanied by the following explanatory note: “The nation’s first census was a count of the U.S. population
as of Aug. 2, 1790. U.S. marshals and their assistants were supposed to visit each U.S. household and record the name of the head
of the household and the number of people in each household in the following categories: Free white males ages 16 and older, free
white males younger than 16, free white females, other free persons, and slaves. This is the first page of the publication containing
the results.

Note: The U.S. Census Bureau does not consider Hispanic/Latino ethnicity to be a race. Hispanics also are asked to select one or
more races to define themselves.” The categorization of Hispanics and Latinos is described in the following detailed timeline:

1930 - Mexicans were counted as a separate race (not an ethnicity or nationality) for the first and only time. Prior to this, they
were categorized racially as white, dating back to the first time they were included in the census in 1850.
1940 - The Mexican racial category was removed and “persons of Mexican birth or ancestry who were not defined as Indian or
some other nonwhite race” were once again deemed white, and marked as a Spanish-speaking population.
1950 and 1960 - Mexicans were counted as “white persons of Spanish surname.”
1970 - A question on “Origin or Descent” was added with an option to choose one of the following: Mexican; Puerto Rican;
Cuban; Central or South American; Other Spanish. Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban origins were separately identified due to
these groups being the largest estimated Hispanic populations in the U.S. at the time.
1980 - “Hispanic” and “not Hispanic” were deemed distinct and separated from race. According to the Census, individuals who
are Hispanic may be of any race. The Mexican category was expanded to include “Mexican, Mexican-Amer[ican], Chicano.”

1990 - For the Hispanic origin question, a list of examples and a write-in line were introduced that read, “Print one group, for
example, Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on.”
2000 - People could report more than one race for the first time. “Other Spanish/Hispanic” was changed to “Another Hispanic,
Latino, Spanish origin,” which introduced the Latino label.
2010 - “Another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” category now provided examples of six Hispanic origin groups
“(Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, Spaniard, and so on)” and instructed respondents to “print
origin.”
2020 - The example Hispanic groups were revised to represent the largest Hispanic population groups and the geographic
diversity of the Hispanic or Latino category.

Despite the Census questions, categories, and labels changing over time, many Latinxs have clear opinions about their identities.
According to studies from the Pew Research Center:

When it comes to describing their identity, most Hispanics prefer their family’s country of origin over pan-ethnic terms.
In 2019, 47% of Hispanics reported most often describing themselves by their family’s country of origin, using labels such as
“Mexican” or “Cuban” or “Dominican,” for example.
Most Hispanics do not perceive a shared common culture among U.S. Hispanics. According to a 2011 national survey of
Latinos, nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say Hispanics in the U.S. have many different cultures, while 29% say Hispanics in the U.S.
share a common culture.
 Like the prior point, this statistic suggests that among Hispanics, national identities remain prevalent.
“Hispanic” or “Latino”? Most don’t care—but among those who do, “Hispanic” is preferred. More than half (54%) say
they have no preference for either term. When a preference is expressed, “Hispanic” is preferred over “Latino”—27% versus
18%.
Most Afro-Latinos identify as “Hispanic” or “Latino,” but not all do. About one in seven Afro-Latinos do not identify as
Hispanic. As of 2020, there are about 6 million Afro-Latino adults in the U.S. (12% of the adult Latino population).
The racial groups Afro-Latinos identify with can be varied and diverse. When asked about their race on a Census Bureau-
style question, about three in ten Afro-Latinos selected White as their race, 25% chose Black and 23% selected “some other
race.” An additional 16% selected multiple races, while just 1% said they were Asian. Afro-Latinos who did not identify as
Latino were more likely than those who did identify this way to mark Black as their race (59% vs. 17%).
Most Hispanics use Spanish, but the use of English rises through the generations. The same 2011 survey found that 38% of
all respondents are Spanish-dominant, 38% are bilingual, and 24% are English-dominant. Among U.S.-born Hispanics, more
than half (51%) are English-dominant.
Hispanics also want future U.S. Hispanic generations to speak Spanish. Fully 95% of Hispanics believe it is very important
(75%) or somewhat important (20%) for future generations of Hispanics in the U.S. to be able to speak Spanish.

As  you  learned  in  this  section,  race,  ethnicity,  and  different  subgroups  have  been  reclassified  and  redefined  in  the  census.  In
“Gateway to Whiteness: The Census and Hispanic/Latino Identity,” Gustavo Chacon Mendoza argues that the census is significant
because  it  shapes  national,  group,  and  individual  identity  through  its  official  classification  system.  He  argues,  “by  narrowly
defining  ethnicity  and  restricting  its  availability  as  a  census  answer,  the  census  will  force  people  to  identify  themselves  in
groupings  that  do  not  match  their  social  perception  and  standing.”   However,  the  number  of  Hispanics/Latinos  that  selected
“Some Other Race” swelled in the 2020 census––a selection that can be read as a protest to the current racial categorizations. The
census,  however,  interprets  this  occurrence  as  confusion  or  failure  to  understand  the  race  question,  denying  respondents  agency.
Caribbean scholar Jorge Duany notes, “The existence of a large and growing segment of the U.S. population that perceived itself
ethnically as Hispanic or Latino, while avoiding the major accepted racial designations, is a politically explosive phenomenon.”
In  sum,  there  are  major  limitations  with  a  government  entity  attempting  to  categorize  a  diverse  group  of  people  and  impose
meanings “from above.” While census data can provide a glimpse into understanding Latinx communities, it is important to also
examine the perspectives, stories, and contexts that surround the numbers, which is the goal of the following sections.

## 2.2: (Re)constructing Latinidad(es)

Hispanic or Latino: What’s the Difference?

This section unpacks the questions: What is the difference between Hispanic and Latino and where did these labels come from?
What does it mean to be Latinx and who gets to decide? These are key inquiries to better understand Latinx identities, the focus of
this chapter.

The term Hispanic has been in English usage since the eighteenth century. In the 1940s it was mostly used by scholars to “describe
the descendants of the original Spanish colonial territories that became part of the United States in the nineteenth century (Florida,
New  Mexico,  Arizona,  California),  while  ‘Latino’  was  more  aptly  used  to  describe  immigrants  from  Latin  America,  of  course,
with some geographic and temporal exceptions.”  Interestingly, the idea of Latin America was a mid-nineteenth-century invention,
constructed by intellectuals from Spain’s former colonies who sought to describe the new political order that arose in the aftermath
of revolutions and independence movements across the Western hemisphere.

During the 1960s, in the context of anticolonial revolutions abroad and the Black power and American Indian movements at home,
the Chicano and Puerto Rican (or Boricua) ethnic nationalist movements also emerged in the U.S. These movements identified
with the Indigenous peoples of their respective homelands and oppressed peoples across the Third World, now referred to as the
Global South. They used the concept of internal colonialism to analyze their historical, political, and economic circumstances in the
U.S. as that of colonized minorities, rather than immigrants. It was in this context that the U.S. government began to use the term
Hispanic. To some, especially in the Southwest, it was a term that tried to depoliticize their identity and erase the Indigenous and
African origins of many Latin Americans. Hispanic was used in the Southwest by Spanish-origin elites to distinguish themselves
from Mexicans of Indigenous and African heritage and many Chicanos found the term offensive. Puerto Ricans on the East Coast
more readily accepted the term more readily because they linked it to their country’s resistance to Anglicization by maintaining the
Spanish language as an important part of their identity and ethnic pride.

Latinidad

Historically Hispanic and Latino have been used to describe groups of people and not used for the purposes of self-identification or
collective  action.  That  is,  until  a  group  of  Mexican  Americans  and  Puerto  Ricans  came  together  in  Chicago,  Illinois  as  Latinos,
forging  a  collective  pan-ethnic  identity  to  demand  their  civil  rights  in  the  1970s.  This  was  one  of  the  earliest  moments  that
Latinidad was used strategically for political mobilization.

 Key Term: Latinidad

  “...A  political  project  that  cultivates  a  broad  cultural  sense  of  belonging  to  a  grander  community  that  is  created  through
ancestral  links  to  Latin  America.”   In  other  words,  Latinidad  suggests  a  shared  subjectivity  among  disparate  ethnic  and
national  groups  with  shared  attributes,  experiences,  and  realities  among  its  members.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that
similarities do not equal sameness. There is diversity within and among the grander community.

More Latin Americans from different parts of the continent began entering the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s and people of Mexican
and Puerto Rican origin were becoming more geographically dispersed. This resulted in the term Latino becoming common in the
1980s  as  an  alternative  to  Hispanic,  growing  out  of  the  same  political  consciousness  as  Chicano  and  Boricua.  The  term  Latino
expanded to all Latin Americans, acknowledging a shared complex historical experience of colonization and oppression. By 2000,
the term Latino had lost much of its radical edge as the mainstream media began to adopt it and the census offered “Hispanic or
Latino” as a category that same year. Eventually, corporations, government organizations, and dominant culture industries would
come  to  understand  Latinidad  as  an  opportunity  to  advance  their  own  agendas,  often  resulting  in  the  homogenization  and
commodification of the rich diversity of Latinx communities.

Latinidades

At  the  same  time,  new  ethnic  enclaves  were  developing  where  Latinxs  of  diverse  heritages  resided  side-by-side.  “This  social
mosaic  leads  to  new  forms  of  interaction,  affinities,  and  power  dynamics  between  and  among  Latinas/os  from  various  national
groups,”  including  “different  forms  of  affiliations,  solidarity,  identifications,  desire,  and  intermarriage  among  Latinas/os.”   As
reported in section 2.1, many Latinxs prefer to identify with their national identities, however, this statistic obscures the fact that
this is not the only frame of reference for self-identification. Latina/o studies Professor Emerita Frances R. Aparicio argues that in

fact,  “national  identities  are  restructured  and  reorganized  as  a  result  of  these  increasingly  hybrid  spaces.  New  interlatino
subjectivities  are  emerging  and  we  need  to  examine  them  at  various  levels.”   For  example,  Latinxs  are  creating  new  cultural
productions including music, food, clothing, and language practices that coalesce from the multiple cultures within their families
and neighborhoods. Hybrid identifications are also emerging that fuse two or more ethnic, racial, national, or tribal labels such as
Ticano  (Costa  Rican  and  Chicano),  MexiRican  (Mexicana  and  Puertorriqueña),  BlaXican  (Black  and  Xicanx),  and  Apachicana
(Apache and Chicana) to name a few. These hybrid labels indicate a desire for terms that capture the complexities of individual
identities that are not expressed with existing national identities or with the terms Chicana/o/x or Latina/o/x.

It is imperative to recognize the nuances, complexities, and heterogeneity of Latinidad if it is to be used for self and community
empowerment. Aparicio urges Latinx studies scholars and students to consider the plural Latinidades, which refers to “the shared
experiences of subordination, resistance, and agency of the various national groups of Latin America in the United States.”  She
describes Latinidades “as a conceptual framework” that can be used “to document, analyze, and theorize the processes by which
diverse  Latinas/os  interact  with,  dominate,  and  transculturate  each  other.”   This  framework  is  aligned  with  the  relational,
transnational,  and  intersectional  approaches  found  across  this  book  because  it  calls  for  the  examination  of  “power  differences,
conflicts, tensions, and affinities between and among Latinas/os of diverse national identities.”

Scholars and activists have taken up the call to consider the plural Latinidades through the development of three complementary
frameworks:  Critical  Latinx  Indigeneities,  AfroLatinidad,  and  Queer  Latinidad.  These  concepts  reflect  the  realities,  experiences,
and histories that are not fully captured by the term Latinidad alone. Drawing on hemispheric and comparative Indigenous studies,
Critical Latinx Indigeneities “emerges out of a need to examine how Indigenous migrants from Latin America are transforming
notions of Latinidad and Indigeneity in the U.S.”  The term Indígena has come into use as a pan-ethnic term of empowerment as
have  the  variations  Indigenous  Latina/o/x  and  Indigenous  Xicana/o/x  (Xicana/o/x  Indígena  in  Spanish),  though  most  individuals
prefer to self-identify with their specific tribal nation, pueblo, or community in their own language (for example, Yoeme, Wixárika,
P’urhépecha, Kumeyaay, etc.). “This specificity generally affords respect for the vast differences among Indigenous peoples of the
Americas,  standing  in  marked  contrast  to  references  to  the Indian, the Native American….”   For  more  on  Latinx  Indigeneities
visit Chapter # 4: Indigeneities. Another framework that expands notions of Latinidad is AfroLatinidad, which centers Blackness as
an analytic, acknowledging the particularities of Latin American peoples of African descent, from their racialized experiences in
their  countries  of  origin  to  the  shifting  racial  meanings  in  the  U.S.,  as  well  as  their  experiences  with  colorism  within  the  larger
Latinx community. Critical Latinx Indigeneities and AfroLatinidad are important frameworks that complicate Latinx racial identity
and provide nuance to understand the Latinx population boom.

Additionally, Queer Latinidad considers  queer  identity  in  relation  to  Latina/o/x  subjectivity,  engaging  in  modes  of  inquiry  that
center  racialized  genders  and  sexualities,  while  simultaneously  challenging  the  construction  and  validity  of  normative  identity
categories.  Just  as  countless  neologisms  merge  two  or  more  ethnic,  racial,  national,  or  tribal  labels,  others  unite  ethnic,  gender,
and/or  sexual  identity  such  as  joto/a/x,  Chicanx,  Latine,  and  translatina/o/x,  which  combines  trans/transgender  and  Latina/o/x,
while  also  encapsulating  Latin  American  and  latinoamericana/o  identities.  Gay  Puerto  Rican  author,  scholar,  and  performer
Lawrence  La  Fountain-Stokes  notes  that  because  the  “prefix  trans-  is  used  to  indicate  individuals  who  might  have  migrated  (or
whose  family  histories  might  include  migration)  and  who  might  have  transnational  connections,  it  acquires  a  double  valance,
referring to geography and physical displacement as much as to gender identity and expression.”  In Brown  Trans  Figurations:
Rethinking  Race,  Gender,  and  Sexuality  in  Chicanx/Latinx  Studies, transfronterizo scholar  Francisco  J.  Galarte  presents  “brown
trans figurations” as a theoretical frame to examine the nuances of racialized trans subjectivity, embodiment, politics, affect, and
agency. Galarte looks to the possibilities of the coexistence of brownness and transness asserting, “both frames center modes of
relationality”  and  have  a  “shared  expansiveness  and  unboundness.”   For  more  on  Queer  Latinidad  and  how  this  analytic  has
developed into a prominent subfield in Chicanx/Latinx studies, visit Chapter # 6: Jotería Studies.

 Sidebar: An Identity Label Timeline

This timeline  provides readers with a quick reference of the significant identity labels that Chicanxs and Latinxs use to refer
to  themselves  as  discussed  in  this  chapter.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  the  mid-twentieth  century  to  the  present  and  the  shifting
spellings  of  terms  and  their  associated  meanings.  Even  though  this  is  a  timeline,  it  is  not  a  linear  chronology.  Some  terms
circulated  in  specialized  circles  prior  to  their  popularization,  and  the  emergence  of  one  label  did  not  necessarily  replace  its
antecedent. Typically, a segment of the population took up a new term that was not utilized, or even known or regarded, by
everyone in the community. All of the labels included in this timeline are still in use today, albeit in different ways, despite
their  emergence  and  popularity  in  a  given  timeframe.  Moreover,  this  is  not  an  exhaustive  list.  Other  national,  regional,  and

personal racial and ethnic identity labels are not included. Finally, it is important to note that there are in-group critiques of and
resistance to all of these labels, which are not covered here. A potential research project could expand on this timeline.

Chicano - late 1960s to 1980s

Students and community activists resignified the once denigrated term Chicano into an empowering alternative to
“Mexican,” “Mexican American,” “Hispanic,” and “Spanish American.”
During the early decades of El Movimiento, Chicano––with the masculine “o” word ending––was often used to refer to a
mixed-gender group, including women, which was, and in many ways still is, customary in the Spanish language.
Androcentric naming was common during this era. Many organizations (e.g. National Association for Chicano Studies),
publications (e.g. Chicano Federation Newsletter, Chicano Liberation), and programs and departments (e.g. Department of
Chicano Studies at California State University, Los Angeles) all used “Chicano.”
Thus, the use of “Chicano” is both a temporal and ideological referent.
Chicano is typically used today by politicized Mexican American men.

Chicana, Chicana/o - late 1960s to 1990s

Chicanas (the “a” feminine word-ending referring to women) sought to challenge the colonially gendered Spanish language
dichotomy by substituting Chicano for Chicana, Chicana and Chicano, and Chicana/o in various realms. Their advocacy
is evidenced in the titles of numerous community, campus, and academic publications and in the renaming of NACS to
National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) and the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies at
the University of California, Santa Barbara, for example.
“Inserting this feminine form of the noun—ChicanA—into Chicano movement discourse demanded inclusion and
challenged sexism in the movement, while at the same time refusing to negate community.”
The editors of Keywords for Latina/o Studies (2017) comment on their decision to use the forward slash (/) claiming their
use of “‘Latina/o’ is intended to honor interventions by feminist scholars to disrupt the Spanish-language masculine use of
‘o’ as a default in ‘Latino.’” They understand “Latina/o” to be “a productive tension rather than reaffirming a gendered
binary.”

Xicana, Xicano - 1980s to 2000s

The use of the X at the beginning of Xicana and Xicano is a signal of reclaiming and reconnecting with Indigenous
identity and ancestry.
Some who utilize this label observe Chicano nationalist Indigenismo that drew on post-revolutionary Mexican Indigenismo
and Aztec iconography, including the myth of Aztlán as the Chicano geographical and spiritual homeland. This deployment
has been critiqued for being romanticized, masculinist, and heteropatriarchal. At the same time, the construction of
Indigeneity during El Movimiento permitted Chicano/as to celebrate a previously denigrated and denied aspect of their
identity.
Decolonial theorist Roberto Hernández identifies different constituencies of “Indigenous Xicanos”––the “cultural
nationalists” and the “indigenistas,” who practice a transnational or hemispheric mode of Indigenous political solidarity.
Chicana feminists also intervened in Chicano nationalist constructions of Indigeneity by unsettling myths and binaries that
were delineated during El Movimiento through Xicanisma, an embodied feminist philosophy and praxis, which is explored
in detail in Section 2.4: Xicana Feminist Ontologies: Indigeneity, Spirtuality, and Sexuality.

Chican@, Latin@ - 2000s to 2010s

Chican@ and Latin@ came into usage around the turn of the twenty-first century as a way to signify the fluidity of gender
and to acknowledge a spectrum of identities and expressions rather than a rigid masculine/feminine binary.
This intervention has been described as “part aesthetic response to the cumbersome punctuation of [Chicana and Chicano],
part recognition of emergent digital identities, and part as an instance of queering or making queer.”
In Reading Chican@ Like a Queer: The De-Mastery of Desire Sandra K. Soto describes her use of the technological ending
as “a conscientious departure from certainty, mastery, and wholeness, while still announcing a politicized collectivity.”
She claims the @ “disrupts our desire for intelligibility, our desire for a quick and certain visual register of a gendered body
the split second we see or hear the term.”

Chicanx, Latinx - 2010s to 2020s

Feminist and queer disruptions to the gender binary continue with the “x” word ending in Chicanx and Latinx, which
“signifies fluidity and mobility, setting aside the conventions of ideological, philosophical, and medical binaries that assign
humans to one gender identity out of two when they are born. The ‘x’ in ‘Chicanx’ is nonbinary; it acknowledges self-
determinations that refuse immovable assignments of identity.”
For more on queer Indigenous Xicanx and Latinx identity, see Section ## 4.4: Gender, Sexuality, Migration, and Indigeneity.

Latine - 2020s

Latine has come into usage in Spanish-speaking countries through the work of feminist, nonbinary, and genderqueer
activists and academics. Its proponents argue the pronunciation is natural and already exists for nouns in Spanish (e.g.
estudiante).

The  drastic  growth  of  a  diverse  Latinx  population––impacted  by  structural  factors  such  as  the  end  of  segregation  and  anti-
miscegenation  laws,  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1965  that  ended  racially  discriminatory  national  quotas,  and  U.S.
political,  economic,  and  military  interventions  in  Latin  America––have  contributed  to  a  shift  in  the  ways  race  and  ethnicity  are
understood  in  the  United  States.  Shifting  racial  meanings  are  ongoing  and  have  a  long  history  on  this  continent,  which  will  be
explored in the following sections.

## 2.3: A Brief History of Latinx Racial Formation

Spanish Conquest, Colonialism, and Mestizaje

When national regimes categorize populations, the very act of naming gives them a living reality. ––Ramón A. Gutiérrez

This  section  explores  the  ways  Spanish  conquest  and  colonization  and  U.S.  settler  colonialism  and  imperialism  have  created
hierarchical identity categories inherited by contemporary Chicanxs and Latinxs. While settler projects of racial domination have
attempted  to  cement  social,  economic,  political,  and  national  boundaries,  marginalized  communities  have  always  resisted  and
subverted  these  projects,  including  the  ethnic  and  racial  classifications  imposed  on  them  by  their  oppressors.  For  example,  they
“generate the names they use to refer to themselves as a collectivity, often in their own native language, thus underscoring their
linguistic  resistance  to  domination.”
In  this  way,  race  is  both  an  organizing  principle  and  an  identity,  both  individual  and
collective, that is unstable and evolves.

The  conquest  of  the  territory  that  would  eventually  become  the  United  States  began  with  the  Spanish  empire  laying  down
permanent settlements in Saint Augustine, Florida in 1565, followed by the kingdom of New Mexico in 1598 (which included the
current  states  of  New  Mexico  and  Arizona),  and  the  provinces  of  Texas  in  1691  and  Alta  California  in  1769.  All  of  these
settlements were situated on Spain’s northernmost frontier far away from major Spanish centers, mostly isolated from one another,
and surrounded by diverse Indigenous nations, many who would remain unconquered.
 These factors led to the creation of distinct
regional  hybrid  subcultures  and  affinities  that  were  developed  along  religious  lines.  “Identification  with  Spain's  various  regions
persisted  in  the  Americas  into  the  nineteenth  century,  whether  in  Cuba,  Hispaniola,  Puerto  Rico,  or  Mexico.  Residents  of  the
kingdom  of  New  Mexico  called  themselves  nuevo  mexicanos  and  neomexicanos,  those  in  California  referred  to  themselves  as
californios,  and  those  in  Texas  as  tejanos. Throughout  Spanish  America  loyalty  and  sense  of  attachment  to  the  patria chica,  to
one’s natal place, persisted and remains strong even to this day.”

People  from  the  Iberian  Peninsula  only  began  to  understand  themselves  as  españoles  when  they  became  colonists  in  the
Americas––their  identities  developing  in  relation  to  diverse  Indigenous  peoples  who  they  reduced  to  indios,  a  misnaming  by
Columbus who erroneously believed he had landed in India.

Inventing Indians was to serve an important imperial end for Spain, for by calling the natives indios, the Spaniards erased
and leveled the diverse and complex indigenous political and religious hierarchies they found. Where once there had been
many  ethnic  groups  stratified  as  native  lords,  warriors,  crafts[people],  hunters,  farmers,  and  slaves,  the  power  of  imperial
Spain was not only to vanquish but also to define, largely reducing peoples such as the mighty Aztecs into a defeated Indian
class that soon bore the pain of subjugation as tribute-paying racialized subjects.

These españoles created rigid social hierarchies and ranked people’s calidad, or social standing, through an intricate classification
system that appraised a person’s religion, birthplace, property ownership, and occupation. Over time, race and color became central
organizing factors laid out in the régimen de castas, as racial mixing between Spaniards, Indigenous, and African peoples became
more  common  by  the  mid-eighteenth  century.  For  details  about  the  categories  constructed  through  the  castas  visit  Section  4.1:
Concepts  for  Understanding  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Indigeneities.  This  biological  and  cultural  blending––  a  process  referred  to  as
mestizaje––often occurred through sexual violence and exploitation against Indigenous and African women, which was sanctioned
by the colonial Catholic church.

The casta system of racial classification was not abolished until Mexico’s independence in 1821, however racial and ethnic social
stratification  remained  prevalent  and  echoed  colonial  conceptions  of  identity.  For  example,  Professor  Alicia  Arrizón,  author  of
Queering Mestizaje: Transculturation and Performence (2006) argues, “Before and after the independence wars in Latin American
and  Caribbean  countries,  nationalist  regulations  of  mestizaje  by  the  criollo  elite  (Europeans  born  in  the  Americas)  served  to
eradicate not only Indigeneity but also African heritage. In addition, the effects of blanqueamiento (or whitening) were encouraged
in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  to  improve  and  ‘purify’  the  race,  meaning  the  general  national  racial
composition or the Hispanic race."  Soon after Mexico’s independence, its northern territories would contend with a new imperial
power that would soon imprint its own hierarchical racial structure onto the peoples of that region.

Changing Racial Paradigms Under U.S. Imperialism

Knowledge of the history of relations between the United States and Latin America and the Caribbean is indispensable to
putting  into  focus  the  often  forgotten  events  and  circumstances  that  account  for  the  Latino/a  presence  here.  ––José  Luis
Morín

Racial Formation in the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands

Beginning in the 1820s the fledgling U.S. nation-state sought to expand its empire through the invasion and annexation of Mexico’s
northern  territories,  culminating  in  the  war  of  1846-1848.  Opponents  of  annexation,  predominantly  politicians,  journalists,  and
businessmen, argued that the incorporation of a “mongrel race” would pollute U.S. democracy, which up to that point, had been
built on Indian removal, land theft, genocide, and slavery. Senator John C. Calhoun, a prominent Southern Democratic said, “we
have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race––the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would
be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race… I protest such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government
of a white race.” Protests against annexation would go unheeded, but perspectives such as these would shape race relations in the
decades to come.

Following the end of the war, The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo obliged Mexico to surrender more than 1 million square miles,
nearly half of its territory, for 15 million dollars. The Treaty established social, legal, and political boundaries, which in effect, led
to the incorporation of approximately 75,000-100,000 inhabitants who had been given the option to move south across the newly
drawn geopolitical border or remain in the newly conquered territory and become U.S. citizens. The people absorbed were diverse
and included Mexican mestizos, acculturated Indians, secularized mission Indians, as well as unconquered Indigenous nations such
as the Apache, Comanche, and Diné, complicating the pledge of citizenship and incorporation into the social body. At the time, full
citizenship  rights  were  only  conferred  to  free  whites,  making  it  feasible  for  legislators  to  “disenfranchise  many  Mexicans  by
arguing  that  such  people  were  of  Indian  descent  and  therefore  could  not  claim  the  political  privileges  of  white  citizens.”   In
“Chicano  Indianism,”  social  anthropologist  and  Chicana/o  studies  professor  Martha  Menchaca  aptly  describes  how  the  existing
white supremacist racial paradigm shaped the ways people identified as a survival tactic:

Given  the  nature  of  the  U.S.  racial  system  and  its  laws,  the  conquered  Mexican  population  learned  that  it  was  politically
expedient  to  assert  their  Spanish  ancestry;  otherwise  they  were  susceptible  to  being  treated  as  American  Indians  (Padilla
1979). At the same time, it became politically expedient for American Indians to pass as Mexican mestizos if they wished to
escape the full impact of the discriminatory Indian legislation (Forbes 1973).

 Key Term: Paradigm

“A paradigm is a shared set of understandings or premises which permits the definition, elaboration, and solution of a set of
problems defined within the paradigm. It is an accepted model or pattern…. Paradigms of race shape our understanding and
definition of racial problems.”

The term “Spanish American” rose in popularity, especially among nuevomexicanos, in response to heightened white supremacist
violence  and  discrimination.  By  attempting  to  align  themselves  with  their  European  ancestry,  however  remote,  some  Mexicans
were able to assert their de jure racial whiteness which had been promised to them under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and by
extension distance themselves from Indigeneity and Blackness, which continued to be denigrated under the U.S. racial paradigm as
it  had  under  Spanish  rule.  This  option  to  “pass,”  however,  was  not  available  to  most  Mexicans  who  were  predominantly  of
Indigenous  and  African  ancestry.  “Court  and  legislative  records  from  1848  to  1947  reveal  that  the  skin  color  of  Mexican-origin
people strongly influenced whether they were treated by the legal system as white or as non-white,” however, local governments
found  ways  to  segregate  and  otherwise  discriminate  against  white  Mexicans  based  on  their  Spanish-language  backgrounds  and
other racialized markers of identity.

The  settlers  who  came  to  the  U.S.  Southwest  defined  themselves  as  Anglos  and  Anglo-Americans,  “vaunting  their  superiority,
establishing  structures  of  domination,  and  asserting  that  their  primacy  was  rooted  in  their  Protestant  God,  in  their  laws  and
constabularies, in the purity of their whiteness, and in their very way of life.”  Racial meanings would shift into the next century,
but  always  with  the  underlying  goals  of  protecting  white  property  and  power.  “By  the  1920s,  an  influential  eugenics  movement
attempted to clothe such racism in the prestige of science, arguing that, as a mongrel race, Mexican mestizos threatened the nation
with racial degeneration.”  For more on eugenics and segregation visit Section ## 8.2: The Struggle for Equality, 1900-1954.

Racial Formation in Puerto Rico

The United States continued its imperial wars of conquest through the nineteenth century resulting in the capture of several island
nations including the Kingdom of Hawai’i in 1893 and the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam after the Spanish American
War of 1898, settled through the Treaty of Paris. The original inhabitants would have their social, political, economic, civil, and
human rights repressed and their identities would now be constructed under the U.S. racial paradigm.

Congress followed and extended the precedent set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo by exerting complete control over Puerto
Rico and its inhabitants. The rationale for not granting statehood and political debates around citizenship rights were based on the
white supremacist views of the inferiority of mixed-race people, particularly those of mixed African heritage, who were thought of
as  unable  to  govern  themselves.  Eventually,  statutory  citizenship  was  granted  to  Puerto  Ricans,  but  it  was  merely  “a  way  of
showing  that  they  were  under  U.S.  control,  rather  than  the  purposes  of  inclusion.”   In  “A  Separate  and  Inferior  Race,”  legal
scholar  and  Latinx/Latin  American  studies  professor  José  Luis  Morín  points  out  how  “a  racialized  vision  of  the  peoples  of  the
developing world also proved useful in the establishment of a framework for the unequal application of the law to Latinos/as in the
United States.”   He  goes  on  to  demonstrate  how  decisions  over  the  rights  of  Puerto  Ricans  made  by  the  Supreme  Court  were
shaped by the “separate but equal” treatment applied to African Americans for more than half a century (for more on “Jim Crow”
and  “Juan  Crow”  visit  Section  7.2:  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Civil  Rights  Activism). A  major  distinction  is  that  Plessy  v.  Ferguson
(1896) has since been overturned but the Puerto Rican Insular Cases (1901) have not, resulting in the present and ongoing colonial
status of Puerto Rico and the oppression of its people.

Ethnic Nationalism, Ethnic Pride

Following the emergence of global decolonization movements in the 1940s, twentieth-century civil rights movements in the U.S.,
and part of a larger wave of militant ethnic nationalism, many Mexican American and Puerto Rican community activists, students,
and  faculty  abandoned  assimilationist  forms  of  activism  and  adamantly  rejected  their  racial,  social,  economic,  and  political
marginalization  and  systemic  violence  their  communities  experienced  for  generations.  The  late  1960s  and  early  1970s  marked  a
period of Chicano and Boricua cultural pride, empowerment, self-determination, and liberation. Chicana/o literary scholar Sheila
Marie  Contreras  asserts,  “To  name  oneself  as  ‘Chicana’  or  ‘Chicano’  is  to  assert  a  gendered,  racial,  ethnic,  class,  and  cultural
identity in opposition to Anglo-American hegemony and state-sanctioned practices of representing people of Mexican descent in
the United States. As it evokes the ‘radical’ politics of cultural nationalism, ‘Chicano’ stands against the institutionally normative
‘Hispanic,’ as well as the linguistically insistent ‘Latino.’”  A result of these social movements, Chicano studies and Puerto Rican
studies programs emerged in institutions of higher learning across the U.S., providing students a space to learn about and reconnect
with their histories, philosophies, epistemologies, and intellectual traditions and to develop new politicized identities.

Both Chicanos and Boricuas opposed U.S. imperialism and refuted their association with whiteness, a tactic utilized by previous
generations to secure civil rights. Many who took on these new labels found inspiration in the ideologies, strategies, and aesthetics
of the Black Panther Party and the larger Black Power Movement. “Equally important to both Chicanos and Boricuas was their
assault on racism in its material, psychic, and institutionalized forms. Heralding their personal beauty and pride, both movements
affirmed the beauty of their art, language, culture, and skin color as a way to corrode the toxicity of racism,” illustrated through the
slogan  “Brown  and  Proud”  as  displayed  in  Figure  2.3.1,  which  features  two  youth  activists,  one  holding  up  a  sign  that  reads
“Brown  and  Proud  I’m  the  Next  Generation.”   Similarly,  Chicana  feminists  would  go  on  to  develop  new  theories—ones  that
centered gender, sexuality, Indigeneity, and spirituality, grounded in their embodied identities and experiences, which are explored
further in the next section.

## 2.4: Xicana Feminist Ontologies- Indigeneity, Spirituality, and Sexuality

Mestiza Consciousness

In  her  seminal  text  Borderlands  La  Frontera:  The  New  Mestiza  (1987),  Gloria  Anzaldúa  moves  away  from  masculinist,
heterosexist, nationalist, and biological notions of mestizaje attributing new meaning to identity construction through her concept
of  “mestiza  consciousness”—one  that  emerges  from  life  in  the  Borderlands  (for  more  on  Borderlands  studies  visit  Section 3.1:
What is Chicanx/Latinx History).
 Mestiza consciousness is a cognitive decolonization process of racialized, gendered, and sexed
subjects wherein la mestiza becomes aware of the Borderlands and makes conscious decisions regarding the construction of her
multiple  and  often  contradictory  identities.  Through  mestiza  consciousness––later  conceptualized  as  “conocimiento”––la  nueva
mestiza  rethinks  her  material,  psychic,  and  spiritual  existence  as  she  negotiates  contradictions  and  ambiguities  as  a  subject-in-
process who is constantly constructing provisional identities. AnaLouise Keating, feminist scholar and editor of Anzaldúa’s work,
succinctly describes Anzaldúa’s theory of the new mestiza as “an innovative expansion of previous biologically based definitions
of mestizaje. For Anzaldúa, new mestizas are people who inhabit multiple worlds because of their gender, sexuality, color, class,
bodies,  personality,  spiritual  beliefs,  and/or  other  life  experiences.  This  theory  offers  a  new  concept  of  personhood  that
synergistically combines apparently contradictory Euro-American and Indigenous traditions."

Xicanisma

Chicana feminists continued to intervene in Chicano nationalist constructions of Indigeneity by unsettling myths and binaries that
were  delineated  during  El  Movimiento  through  Xicanisma,  an  embodied  feminist  philosophy  and  praxis.  “During  the  1990s  a
cohort  of  Chicana  feminists  began  replacing  the  Ch  in  ‘Chicana’  with  a  capital  X  (Xicana)  in  order  to  summon  the  lexical
appearance––and  sound––of  Nahuatl,  an  ancient  but  still  living  Indigenous  language.  …Contemporary  Xicana  feminist  sonic,
lexical, and political replacements of the Ch with an X are meant to point to Indigenous uprisings within and throughout Chicana,
Chicano, and Chicanx identities. Today, the spoken and written grapheme X acts as a mobile signifier that points to identities-in-
redefinition."

Early deployments of the term Xicana include Ana Castillo’s critical text Massacre of the Dreamers: Essays on Xicanisma (1994)
and  La  Red  Xicana  Indígena,  an  organization  founded  in  1997.  Castillo  further  complicates  queer  Indigeneity  and  mestizaje
through her use of the term “mestiza/Mexic Amerindian” to assert a U.S. Indigenous, pre-colonial Olmec, Spanish, and Mexican
lineage.  The  label  Xicana,  Castillo  argues,  affirms  Indigenous  ancestry,  spirituality,  and  sexuality,  and  considers  other  multiple,
crosscutting identities. She accounts for the Arab and North African racial mixing that shaped Iberian culture and the subsequent
racial  mixture  with  Indigenous  peoples  of  the  Americas  during  the  Spanish  conquest.  Castillo  critiques  sexism  prevalent  within
contemporary U.S. white supremacist culture, Mexican Catholicism, and some pre-conquest patriarchal Indigenous cultures, such
as  the  Aztecs.  She  argues  these  multiple  sites  of  sexism  across  time  and  space  have  led  to  the  subordination  of  Indigenous
womanhood and are a result of spiritual imbalance due to the omission of the “feminine principle.”  Castillo refutes the Chicano
propensity to glorify and romanticize male supremacist aspects of pre-conquest Aztec culture.

Castillo  introduces  the  term  Xicanisma,  a  retrofitted  form  of  Chicana  feminism  intended  to  create  an  avenue  for  mestizas  and
detribalized  Indigenous  women  to  “not  only  reclaim  our  Indigenismo––but  also  to  reinsert  the  forsaken  feminine  into  our
consciousness."   In  order  to  heal  from  historical,  institutional,  and  personal  traumas,  Castillo  advocates  acknowledging  and
honoring  the  feminine  side  of  our  complementary  feminine/masculine  duality.  To  do  this,  she  writes,  would  restore  spiritual
balance.  This  restorative  act  challenges  U.S.  white  supremacy,  Chicano  heteropatriarchy,  and  the  Catholic  Church––all  rely  on
stringent  dichotomies  that  repress  women’s  spirituality  and  sexuality.  For  Castillo,  Xicanisma  is  “an  ever  present  consciousness
of interdependency specifically rooted in our culture and history."  Xicanisma is a practical way for retribalizing peoples of any
gender to express an Indigenous sensibility, reconnect spirituality with the body/sexuality, and to (re)claim and (re)construct their
traditions in a way that serves their present needs.

Similarly,  Xicana  lesbian  activist  and  playwright  Cherríe  Moraga  explains  her  use  of  the  X  indicates  “a  reemerging  política,
especially among young people, grounded in Indigenous American belief systems and identities... [that] reflects the Indian identity
that has been robbed from us through colonization... As many Raza may not know their specific Indigenous nation of origin, the X
links  us  as  Native  people  in  diaspora.”   Moraga  is  co-founder  of  La  Red  Xicana  Indígena,  (The  Indigenous  Xicana  Woman’s
Network), along with Celia Herrera Rodríguez, a collective of scholar- and community-activists who define themselves as

a network actively involved in political, educational, and cultural work that serves to raise indigenous consciousness among
our communities and supports the social justice struggles of people of indigenous American origins North and South. Our

name...further signifies our alliance with all Red Nations of the Américas, including nations residing in the North. We are a
pueblo  made  up  of  many  indigenous  nations  in  diaspora  who  through  a  five  hundred  year  project  of  colonization,
neocolonization,  and  de-indianization,  have  been  forced  economically  from  their  place  of  origin,  many  ending  up  in  the
United  States…  [W]e  stand  with  little  legal  entitlement  to  our  claim  as  indigenous  peoples  within  America;  however,  we
come together on the belief that, with neither land base nor enrollment card––like so many urban Indians in the North, and so
many displaced and undocumented migrants coming from the South, we have the right to “right” ourselves.

The writers of this document further explain that Xicana Indígena politics re-envision “families apart from the Eurocentric model
of the privatized patriarchal family,” and seek to “draw examples from the tribal structure of...indigenous antecedents.” Moraga,
along with co-founder Celia Herrera Rodríguez, advocate for raising the consciousness of younger generations through alternative
and  creative  learning  environments  that  “closely  reflect  an  indigenous  point  of  view.”  In  sum,  mestiza  consciousness  and
Xicanisma are Ch/Xican/x feminist ontologies––philosophical explorations of the nature of being––grounded in a decolonial and
liberatory praxis.

## 2.5: Conclusion

Summary

“Identity” is two-faced. It is used to represent both intrapsychic states and relational processes: It can be claimed to be both
socially  constructed  and  transhistorically  essential,  a  being  and  a  doing,  ascribed  and  attained,  made  in  language  and
exceeding language, simultaneously intensely private and biographical, a locus for political struggle, and the focus [of] state
power. It is formed along multiple historically formed social vectors we call gender, class, race, sexuality, and so on, but it is
also, simply, about one's own experience here and now. ––David Valentine

The epigraph above by cultural and linguistic anthropologist David Valentine, succinctly captures what identity is and what identity
does, which has been the focus of this chapter.
 Latinx demographics and the factors that impact them were reviewed, including
various  historical,  political,  and  social  processes.  These  processes  have  also  shaped  the  racialization  of  Chicanxs  and  Latinxs
impacting  their  experiences,  life  outcomes,  and  self-identification.  This  chapter  also  introduced  Chicanx/Latinx  studies  identity
concepts, theories, and frameworks, which provide a foundation for understanding the Chicanx/Latinx communities who are the
subject of this textbook.

Ancillary materials for this chapter are located in Section ## 11.2: Chapter 2 Resource Guide, which includes slides, media, writing

Key Terms

Race:  A  social  construct  created  by  European  colonists  and  revised  by  American  pseudo-scientists  which  sorts  people  by
phenotype  into  global,  social,  and  political  hierarchies.  It  is  both  an  organizing  principle  and  an  identity,  both  individual  and
collective. Race is unstable and evolves due to social, historical, political, and legal processes, but is often misrecognized as natural
and fixed.

Ethnicity:  Meanings,  values,  practices,  and  expressions  of  a  group  that  understands  itself  to  be  linked  by  a  shared  way  of  life.
Ethnicity often involves fictive or actual bonds of kinship and/or a related widespread sense of common collective origin, ancestry,
homeland,  and  history  and  may  include  a  common  language  and  cultural  system  or  customs  such  as  religion,  mythology,  ritual,
food, dress, and style.

Social identities: The ways in which a person understands themselves as belonging to a social group. Examples of social identity
categories  include  race,  ethnicity,  gender,  sexuality,  socio-economic  status,  religion,  and  the  like.  The  ways  an  individual  self-
identifies within these categories––the labels that one uses––is a personal choice and may shift depending on the context.

Social  construct:  When  meaning  is  contextual  and  changes  over  time  and  place  as  a  result  of  social,  political,  and  historical
processes.

Intersectionality: A mode of analysis developed by feminists of color that examines how power structures (ideologies, discourses,
institutions,  systems)  shape  particular  subject  positions,  access  to  resources,  experiences,  and  life  outcomes  and  how  these  vary
based  on  the  intersecting  dynamics  of  gender,  class,  language,  religion,  ability,  sexuality,  tribal  affiliation,  nationality,  and
immigration status.

Hispanic: People in the U.S. with heritage from Spanish-speaking countries. Federal, state, and private agencies and organizations
that collect demographic data define Hispanic as an ethnicity, even though many who identify with this term define it as a race as
well as an ethnicity, due to the fact that those who are understood as belonging to this group have been racialized.

Latino:  People  in  the  U.S.  of  Latin  American  descent,  acknowledging  a  shared  complex  historical  experience  of  colonization,
oppression, and resistance.

Chicano:  A  once  denigrated  term,  was  resignified  in  the  late  1960s  and  1970s  by  students  and  community  activists  into  an
empowering  alternative  to  “Mexican,”  “Mexican  American,”  “Hispanic,”  or  “Spanish”  as  part  of  a  larger  cultural  nationalist
movement.

Boricua: A term derived from Borikén, the Indigenous Taíno name for the island of Puerto Rico. Boricua is an empowering group
identification that people of Puerto Rican descent took on in the 1970s as a part of a larger cultural nationalist movement.

Panethnicities:  “Confederations  created  when  several  distinct  ethnic  groups  come  together  in  alliance  for  social,  economic,  or
cultural advantage, thereby augmenting their numeric power and influence around issues of common concern.”

Latinidad: A shared subjectivity among disparate Latin American ethnic and national groups with shared attributes, experiences,
and realities among its members.

Interlatino subjectivities: The result of cultural contact and mixing between different Latinx national identity groups resulting in
the creation of new hybrid cultural productions from music, food, clothing, aesthetics, and language that coalesce from the multiple
cultures in their families and neighborhoods.

Latinidades:  An  extension  beyond  the  singular  Latinidad,  referring  to  “the  shared  experiences  of  subordination,  resistance,  and
agency of the various national groups of Latin American in the United States.” It is “a conceptual framework” that can be used “to
document, analyze, and theorize the processes by which diverse Latinas/os interact with, dominate, and transculturate each other.”
Latinidades also calls for the examination of “power differences, conflicts, tensions, and affinities between and among Latinas/os
of diverse national identities.”

Critical  Latinx  Indigeneities:  A  framework  that  emerges  at  the  intersections  of  Latinx  studies,  Latin  American  studies,  and
Indigenous studies to examine how Indigenous migrants from Latin America are transforming notions of Latinidad and Indigeneity
in the U.S.

Indígena: A pan-ethnic Spanish term of empowerment to refer to an Indigenous person from Latin America.

AfroLatinidad: A  term  that  centers  Blackness  as  an  analytic,  acknowledging  the  particularities  of  Latin  American  peoples  of
African descent, from their racialized experiences in their countries of origin to the shifting meanings in the U.S., as well as their
experiences of colorism within the larger Latinx community.

Queer Latinidad: A concept that considers queer identity in relation to Latina/o/x subjectivity, questioning the construction and
validity of normative identity categories.

Translatina/o/x:  A  neologism  that  combines  trans/transgender  and  Latina/o/x,  while  also  encapsulating  Latin  American  and
latinoamericana/o identities.

Chicana, Chicana/o: Terms that intentionally place the feminine word-ending “a” at the end of Chican- to challenge the colonially
gendered  Spanish  language  masculine/feminine  dichotomy  by  substituting  Chicano  for  Chicana,  Chicana  and  Chicano,  and
Chicana/o.

Xicana/o,  Xicana/o/x  Indígena:  Terms  that  replace  the  “Ch”  in  Chicana/o/x  signaling  a  reclamation  and  reconnection  with
Indigenous ancestry and identity.

Indigenistas: A constituency of Indigenous Xicana/o/xs who practice a transnational or hemispheric mode of Indigenous political
solidarity.

Xicanisma:  A  retrofitted  form  of  Chicana  feminism  developed  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s  intended  to  create  an  avenue  for
mestizas  and  Indigenous  women  to  “not  only  reclaim  our  Indigenismo––but  also  to  reinsert  the  forsaken  feminine  into  our
consciousness.” Xicanisma is a practical way for retribalizing peoples of any gender to express an Indigenous sensibility, reconnect
spirituality with the body/sexuality, and to (re)claim and (re)construct their traditions in ways that serve their present needs.

Chican@,  Latin@:  Terms  that  came  into  usage  around  the  turn  of  the  twenty-first  century  as  a  way  to  signify  the  fluidity  of
gender  and  to  acknowledge  a  spectrum  of  identities  and  expressions  rather  than  a  rigid  masculine/feminine  binary.  The
technological ending has been described as “part aesthetic response to the cumbersome punctuation of [Chicana and Chicano], part
recognition of emergent digital identities, and part as an instance of queering or making queer.”

Chicanx,  Latinx:  Terms  that  are  another  feminist  and  queer  disruption  to  the  gender  binary.  The  “-x”  “signifies  fluidity  and
mobility, setting aside the conventions of ideological, philosophical, and medical binaries that assign humans to one gender identity
out  of  two  when  they  are  born.  The  ‘x’  in  ‘Chicanx’  is  nonbinary;  it  acknowledges  self-determinations  that  refuse  immovable
assignments of identity.”

Latine: A term that has come into usage in Spanish-speaking countries through the work of feminist, nonbinary, and genderqueer
activists and academics. Advocates call attention to its uncomplicated pronunciation.

Régimen de castas: A system of racial classification laid out by Spanish settlers in the mid-eighteenth century to categorize the
resultant  mixing  between  Spaniards,  Indigenous,  and  African  peoples.  The  casta  system  was  not  abolished  until  Mexico’s
independence in 1821, however racial and ethnic social stratification remain prevalent even today, echoing colonial conceptions of
identity.

Mestizaje: The term for the biological and cultural blending that often occurred through sexual violence and exploitation against
Indigenous and African women in the colonial era.

Paradigm: “A shared set of understandings or premises which permits the definition, elaboration, and solution of a set of problems
defined  within  the  paradigm.  It  is  an  accepted  model  or  pattern….  Paradigms  of  race  shape  our  understanding  and  definition  of
racial problems.” U.S. settler colonialism is built on Indigenous elimination and a black/white racial paradigm of white supremacy,
intertwined with neoliberal capitalism and heteropatriarchy.

Mestiza consciousness: A framework developed by queer Chicana theorist Gloria Anzaldúa, which is a cognitive decolonization
process  of  racialized,  gendered,  and  sexed  subjects  wherein  la  mestiza  becomes  aware  of  the  Borderlands  and  makes  conscious
decisions regarding the construction of her multiple and often contradictory identities.

Introduction

History is the story we tell ourselves about how the past explains our present, and the ways in which we tell the story are
shaped by contemporary needs. ––Aurora Levins Morales, “The Historian as Curandera”

Every  culture  tells  stories  about  its  past,  albeit  in  different  forms  and  for  different  purposes.  In  modern  Western  institutions,
including  those  in  the  United  States,  history  is  often  portrayed  as  an  objective  recounting  of  the  past  using  facts  based  on
documentary  evidence.  Chronologically  ordered  dates  are  emphasized  and  the  accomplishments  of  individual  “great  men”  are
highly regarded over complex social processes. This information is then pieced together in a written format. Despite this dominant
approach,  many  other  perspectives  and  methods  exist  concerning  the  production  of  history.  Sometimes,  these  differences  can
produce very different accounts of the same time period or historical event. As mentioned in Section 1.2: Struggle and Protest for
Chicanx and Latinx Studies, the production of history is not impartial. The stories we tell and retell about our society are important
because  they  shape  our  collective  historical  consciousness  and  affect  our  contemporary  understandings  of  social  phenomena,  as
described in the epigraph by Aurora Levins Morales.

The study of the ways a group, culture, or discipline constructs its history is called historiography. Chicanx/Latinx  history,  like
other subfields explored in this textbook, does not mean simply studying Chicanxs/Latinxs as a topic or theme, nor does it apply an
additive model to an already existing discipline (for example including a one-page biography on Cesar Chavez in a U.S. history
textbook). Chicanx/Latinx history is a subfield within Chicanx/Latinx studies, created by and for the community, and is comprised
of its own critical approaches, perspectives, and methods, which you will be introduced to in this chapter. We begin by exploring
what Chicanx/Latinx history is, how it differs from the dominant discipline of history, and the myriad ways Chicanx/Latinx studies
scholars create, revise, and correct historical narratives.

## 3.1: What is Chicanx/Latinx History?

Chicanx/Latinx Studies Disruptions in U.S. History

At the turn of the 21st century Joseph Rodríguez and Vicki L. Ruiz, two prominent Chicanx/Latinx studies historians, completed a
comprehensive review of U.S. history textbooks, finding the representation of Latinxs to be lacking in both quantity and quality,
particularly  before  1985.  In  “At  Loose  Ends:  Twentieth-Century  Latinos  in  Current  United  States  History  Textbooks,”  they
observed,

While United States survey writers have infused their narratives with stories and actors from African American and women's
history, Latinos are still too frequently reduced to numbers, faceless statistics who wander in and out of the text—nameless
lost  souls,  seemingly  at  loose  ends.  Individual  stories  remain  untold  in  these  baseline  narratives,  especially  with  regard  to
women’s aspirations and attainments.

The authors found common issues across several U.S. history survey texts including the homogenization of diverse Latinx groups
in  terms  of  their  national,  ethnic,  and  racial  identity  as  well  as  their  immigration  status  and  classed  experiences;  disconnected
information across large swaths of time; omission of groups’ histories in the U.S. before the 20th century; and an overall lack of
context  and  nuance,  particularly  with  regards  to  U.S.  imperialism  in  Latin  America.  Many  textbooks  portray  “the  history  of  the
United States and its culture as the direct and exclusive result of the ingenuity, initiative, and hard work of Anglo-Saxon settlers
and  their  descendants.  Almost  unfailingly,  when  people  of  color  were  discussed  at  all  in  these  books…  they  were  portrayed  as
obstacles or threats that intrepid Anglos were forced to overcome.”  In sum, U.S. history textbooks fall short in their representation
of Latinxs. Latinx history also lacks representation in K-12 curricula and mass media (for more on this, visit Chapter 8: Education
and Activism and Section 10.1: Chicanx and Latinx Identities and Culture, respectively), leaving students and the general public
with large knowledge gaps on the subject.

The field of Latinx history emerged, at least in part, to disrupt dominant (mis)representations (including the omissions) of Chicanxs
and Latinxs by revising, recasting, and correcting historical narratives from the vantage point of the colonized, the immigrant, the
refugee, and the exile  and to demonstrate that Latinx history is U.S. history.

An Overview of Chicanx/Latinx History: Three Approaches

Chicano studies and Puerto Rican studies programs were founded beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and history emerged
as  a  key  subfield  over  the  next  three  decades.  In  “Looking  Back  on  Chicano  History:  A  Generational  Perspective,”  Chicano
historian Albert M. Camarillo describes the foundational Chicano history literature that emerged as being “concerned with ‘bottom
up’ approaches, working-class formations, racialized urban experiences, and group identities shaped by race, ethnic/cultural, and
class factors.”  In other words, the majority of first-generation scholars, many of whom were men, applied a race and class analysis
to the Chicano past to understand present conditions, particularly their subordinate racial and socioeconomic status and political
disenfranchisement. They also examined identity development, community formation, and civil rights advocacy.

While  making  important  advances,  early  histories  tended  to  be  geographically  limited  to  urban  settings  in  Texas  and  California,
were  generally  focused  on  a  restricted  chronology  bookended  by  the  U.S.  War  with  Mexico  and  World  War  II,  and  they  often
disregarded women beyond their role as “producers (laborers) or reproducers (mothers).”  As the field matured in the 1980s and
into  the  1990s,  emerging  scholars  greatly  deepened  and  expanded  the  scope  of  the  field,  “both  building  on  and  challenging  the
field’s foundational scholarship.”  Particularly notable are the studies that centered gender and sexuality as analytical categories,
which  will  be  explored  in  detail  in  the  following  sections.  Collectively,  these  early  scholars  were  journeying  into  uncharted
territory, building the road as they walked.

The 1990s also marked the emergence of Latino studies, including Cuban American, Central American, and Domincan American
studies,  which  like  Chicano  and  Puerto  Rican  studies,  came  about  as  a  result  of  student  and  faculty  activism,  but  this  time  the
advocates  were  mostly  comprised  of  so-called  new  Latinos.  “The  Communist  Revolution  in  Cuba,  the  civil  wars  in  Central
America,  the  end  of  the  Trujillo  dictatorship  in  the  Dominican  Republic,  and  the  passage  of  the  Hart-Cellar  Act  (1965)  in  the
United  States,  to  name  a  few  events,  prompted  a  rapid  and  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  migrants,  exiles,  and  refugees
arriving to the United States during the late twentieth century.”  These events drastically changed the national demographics and
there were now sizable populations in the U.S. from over a dozen countries in Latin America who complicated “our understanding
of Latino history, the Latino experience in the United States, and the ways race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality affect integration.”

Historians in Chicanx/Latinx studies continue to explore new ways to frame and teach history by posing questions such as:

How do we center Latinx history in U.S. history?
What interpretive frameworks and methodologies are best to accomplish that task?
When does Latinx history begin and how are major time periods understood from that point forward?
How do these time periods align with or depart from conventional U.S. history chronologies?
Is periodization the most suitable mode of historical categorization? If not, what others exist and how do they compare?
How is Chicanx/Latinx history being written and by whom?
Who is Chicanx/Latinx written for?
In what ways do U.S. history disciplinary orientations, textbooks, and curricula need to change?

Scholars  worked  to  firmly  establish  Chicanx/Latinx  history  by  interrogating  these  questions  and  more  through  cutting-edge
scholarship and subsequent scholars would continue to push the boundaries of the field.

As you learned in Chapter # 2: Identities, Latinx is a heterogeneous ethnoracial category that encompasses a wide array of peoples
and experiences, thus the field of Latinx history likely includes people who may not identify with this label. As a result, historians
in Latinx studies have had to conceptualize ways to bring these differences together in an intelligible area of study. The answer for
many is to utilize a hemispheric approach, that is, examining transnational histories of the Americas, beyond national, regional, or
even continental borders, accounting for the ways that power structures race, culture, gender, sexuality, and resources across time
and  space.  Put  another  way,  students  are  taught  to  think  beyond  borders  that  contain  the  nation-state  and  expand  the  scope  and
frameworks  many  U.S.  historians  rely  on.  Professor  of  history,  African  American  studies,  and  urban  planning,  Kelly  Lytle
Hernández says that this approach “may be a little unsettling for students trained in more traditional narratives with strict borders,
familiar institutions, and constant westward expansion,” but many find resonance with approaches that “dislocate national triumphs
as a main historical theme, and instead highlight uneven, never complete power struggles” which provides a space for students to
connect “past, present, and future.”  A hemispheric lens also allows for an expansive examination of mobile commodities, ideas,
and peoples in diaspora that flow across imperial geographies.

 Author Spotlight: Gloria E. Anzaldúa

The U.S-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds. And before a
scab forms it hemorrhages again, the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country—a border culture.

Using  her  birthplace  of  South  Texas,  her  Chicana-Tejana  identity,  and  her  queerness  as  a  source  of  theorizing,  Gloria
Anzaldúa’s  groundbreaking  text  Borderlands/La  Frontera:  The  New  Mestiza  (1987)  quite  literally  shifted  the  terrain  of
Chicanx  studies  and  greatly  impacted  the  development  of  borderlands  studies,  which  became  foundational  for  subsequent
scholarship that has taken a hemispheric approach. Expanding on W.E.B. Dubois’ theory of double consciousness, Anzaldúa’s
Borderlands theory challenges imposed nation-state borders, provides new frames for understanding identity, hybridity, and
the  material  realities  of  people  who  reside  in  the  b/Borderlands,  extending  the  notion  of  a  geopolitical  border  in  order  to
explore the boundaries of gender, sexuality, spirituality, language, and other social locations, dislocations, and encounters. An
artist's rendition of Gloria Anzaldúa’s portrait is displayed in Figure 3.1.1.

 Activity: Life in the Borderlands

The following excerpt from Chapter 1 “The Homeland, Aztlán / El otro México” vividly illustrates Anzaldúa’s poetic vision of
life  in  the  Borderlands.  Similarly,  Figure  3.1.2  “I  Will  Never  Stop  Reaching  for  You”  by  non-binary  artist  and  poet  Jess  X.
Snow emotionally captures the longing felt by loved ones separated by the U.S./México border. The three people featured in
the image are adorned with the light of a million shining stars, who, according to the artist represent “the millions of mothers,
fathers,  and  children  throughout  history  who  attempt  to  cross  the  border  into  the  U.S.  Migrants  risk  enormous  loss  in  the
optimism of securing family and community in a new country.” The digital print depicts many images from Anzaldúa’s poem,
most notably, her portrayal of the ocean. Read the poem aloud and examine the image closely. Then discuss the concept of the
Borderlands with a partner or in small groups. How is history represented using poetry and art? What other themes and topics
are addressed?

     I walk through the hole in the fence
            to the other side.
    Under my fingers I feel the gritty wire

In addition to taking a hemispheric or transnational approach, many Latinx historians take a thematic approach  to  research  and
teaching, focusing on key concepts, topics, and themes such as empire, conquest, wars of expansion, and revolution; migration and
nation-building;  industrialization  and  labor;  and  civil  rights  and  resistance  movements,  among  others,  from  the  perspective  of
Latinx populations.

Furthermore, some Chicanx/Latinx and ethnic studies historians take a relational approach, which is the study of how one racial
group is affected by the ways another group is racialized through co-constitutive historical, social, and political processes. Rather
than studying a racially marginalized group in contrast to white supremacist and colonial power structures exclusively, which is the
dominant  paradigm  in  social  science  and  humanities  literature,  a  relational  approach  moves  beyond  a  white/nonwhite  binary  to
 In other words, “...it attends to how, when, where, and to what
examine racially subordinated groups in relation to one another.
extent groups intersect. It recognizes that there are limits to examining racialized groups in isolation.”  Chicana historian Natalia
Molina  asserts  that  we  can  better  understand  how  racial  categories  are  formed  and  how  they  function  if  we  think  about  race

relationally  and  “zoom  out”  as  we  research,  write,  and  teach.  A  relational  view  does  not  advocate  for  simply  comparing  and
contrasting  groups’  experiences,  viewing  them  independently.  Rather,  groups  are  understood  to  be  interdependent.  Molina
writes, we need to ask, “...who else is (or was) present in or near the communities we study—and what difference these groups’
presence makes (or made).”  She continues, we must “consider how the lived experience of one group dramatically affected the
experience of others.”

For those who plan to embark on a historical research project, choosing a research subject is usually the first task in the process.
When doing so, Molina urges us to consider using an organizing principle other than solely race. For example, you can study the
history  of  a  neighborhood  (and  the  different  people  in  it)  rather  than  focusing  only  on  the  experiences  of  Mexican  Americans.
Another  option  is  to  conduct  research  collaboratively  with  those  who  have  different  interests  or  areas  of  expertise.  A  third
suggestion is to reconsider what you already know. Students do not need to discover a historical event or find new sources––they
can take a known historical event or moment and reexamine it from a relational standpoint, perhaps applying a new lens. All three
of these options are reflected in the following case study.

 Sidebar: “Contemporary Peoples/Contested Places"

In 1994, Sarah Deutsch, George J. Sánchez, and Gary Y. Okihiro conducted a collaborative study of Japanese internment and
its effects on Boyle Heights.
 The study found that internment affected “Japanese and non-Japanese residents alike. The local
high school lost one-third of its senior class due to internment. An English teacher at the school began a round-robin letter-
writing campaign to encourage her students to write to their fellow classmates interned in the camps. In another notable case, a
Mexican teenager went to live in the camps to demonstrate solidarity with his friends. These stories add a different experience
to  the  prevailing  ones  of  racism  directed  against  the  Japanese  [communities]  in  the  aftermath  of  Pearl  Harbor.  Perhaps  the
difference here is that these folks lived in the same neighborhood, went to the same schools, shared favorite family foods, and
thus were able to form ties more readily in the face of adversity. Examples such as these are startling reminders that internment
had profound reverberations beyond the Japanese community.”

Taking into consideration all three approaches discussed in this section, Latin American and U.S. Latino historian Gerald E. Poyo
succinctly defines Latinx history in this way:

[It] spans at least five centuries, challenges strictly drawn historiographic boundaries, and includes many common themes, as
well  as  involving  questions  of  historical  methodology,  incorporating  interdisciplinary  approaches,  providing  chronologies
and  historical  timelines,  and  creating  dialogue  among  pertinent  and  diverse  historiographic  traditions.  Latina/o  history
includes  Latin  American  history,  U.S.  Borderlands  history,  Mexican  American  history,  Cuban  American  history,  Puerto
Rican history, and the history of many other national groups and, of course, the relationship and impact of Latinas/os on the
general trajectory of United States history writ large, especially immigration and ethnic history.

## 3.2: Writing Chicanas/Latinas Into History

Chicana/Latina Studies Disruptions in Chicano/Latino and Women’s History

This  section  highlights  the  contributions  of  interdisciplinary  feminist  scholars  whose  work  seeks  to  recover,  reinterpret,  and
illuminate Chicana/Latina women’s histories, particularly those that center gender and sexuality as analytical categories, thereby
intervening in and expanding Chicanx/Latinx history and women’s history. The field of Chicana studies provided the foundation for
creating Chicana history as a unique area of study (for more on this visit Section 5.6 Activist Scholarship and Chicana and Latina
Studies).  Two  central  topics  emerged  early  on––a  class  analysis  of  women’s  labor  in  the  19th  and  20th  centuries  and  the
recuperation of the historical figure Malintzín Tenepal (for more on this visit Section 5.4 Cultural Activism), which extended the
Chicano people’s origins to the pre-colonial era. Chicana historians have always used a wide range of interdisciplinary theoretical
frameworks,  methods,  and  sources  in  their  scholarship  including  oral  histories,  testimonios,  literary  sources,  teatro  and
performance art, visual art, and personal archival materials such as letters and journals, often illegible to colonial and patriarchal
historiography. This feminist historical complexity is depicted artistically in Figure 3.2.1, which features The MaestraPeace Mural
painted  on  the  Women’s  Building  in  San  Francisco  in  1994  by  Juana  Alicia,  Miranda  Bergman,  Edythe  Boone,  Susan  Kelk
Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton, Irene Perez, and many volunteers. Central to the ornate mural is K’iche’ Guatemalan
human  rights  activist,  feminist,  and  Nobel  Peace  Prize  laureate  Rigoberta  Menchu  Tum  who  holds  Mesoamerican  earth  mother
goddess Coyolxauhqui in her left hand and Santería ocean mother goddess Yemaya in her right hand. The mural conveys many
themes including the healing power of women’s wisdom, the spiritual-physical connections between women, earth, and water, and
women as important historical actors across time and place.

The  interdisciplinary  nature  of  Chicana  feminist  scholarship  “made  it  difficult  for  mainstream  scholars  to  acknowledge  and
legitimize  Chicana  Studies,  and  Chicana  history  more  specifically,  as  an  academic  field.”   In  addition,  many  Chicanas  faced
poverty and a lack of access to higher education into the 1980s, resulting in the slow development of Chicana history. However, by
the  late  1980s  and  1990s,  significant  numbers  of  Chicanas  and  Latinas  entered  academia,  earned  doctorate  degrees,  and  began
publishing groundbreaking studies, including those that examined gender, sexuality, culture, and power.

La Cultura Cura: Medicinal Histories

One example is the seminal essay “The Historian as Curandera,” by Puerto Rican Jewish writer, artist, historian, and healer Aurora
Levins Morales. The essay is a curandera handbook for socially committed historians invested in disrupting imperial  histories,
which she defines as manufactured official histories wielded by a colonizing power or repressive regime “to attack the sense of
history  of  those  they  wish  to  dominate  and  attempt  to  take  over  and  control  people’s  relationship  to  their  own  past.”  Imperial
histories  are  created  to  justify  and  explain  oppressive  power  imbalances  by  naturalizing  them,  making  them  seem  inherent  and
permanent. This is accomplished by disrupting the transmission of intergenerational knowledge through the destruction of cultural
traditions  and  records,  thereby  damaging  the  colonized  group’s  sense  of  historical  identity.  To  remedy  the  damage  caused  by
imperial histories, a curandera historian,

…uses history, not so much to document the past as to restore to the dehistoricized a sense of identity and possibility. Such
‘medicinal histories’ seek to re-establish the connections between peoples and their histories, to reveal the mechanisms of
power,  the  steps  by  which  their  current  condition  of  oppression  was  achieved,  through  a  series  of  decisions  made  by  real
people to dispossess them; but also to reveal the multiplicity, creativity and persistence of resistance among the oppressed.

 Activity: Apply Your Knowledge

The  following  list  is  a  summary  of  15  characteristics  and  practices  presented  in  “The  Historian  as  Curandera”  that  student-
scholars can use as a guide to begin a medicinal history research project. Review the list and discuss the questions listed and
any others that come up with a partner or in a small group. The list can also be used to review scholarship to determine if it
meets the criteria to be considered a medicinal history.

1. Tell Untold or Undertold Histories. Whose stories are missing or incomplete?
2. Centering Women Changes the Landscape. This does not mean taking an additive approach by including women in the

story. “If women are assumed to be the most important people in the story, how will that change the questions we ask? How
will it change our view of what events and processes are important? How will it change the answers that have already been
asked?”

3. Identify Strategic Pieces of Misinformation and Contradict Them. “We need to ask ourselves what aspects of imperial

history do the most harm, and which lies are at the foundations of our colonized sense of the culture.”

4. Make Absences Visible. The purpose is to interrogate history, generate questions, and show inconsistencies just as much as

it is to document history. If there is a lack of evidence, name and describe what is missing.

5. Asking Questions Can Be As Good As Answering Them.
6. What Constitutes Evidence? History as a discipline relies heavily on written evidence. Just because something is written
down does not make it true. Ask yourself, what is missing if we only rely on written evidence? What other sources, other
mechanisms of memory, exist?

7. Show Agency. Being oppressed does not equate to being a passive powerless victim. Resistance consists of a broad range

of activities. What forms of agency can you identify?

8. Show Complexity and Embrace Ambiguity and Contradiction. We must work to show nuance and complex historical

processes rather than relying on simplistic and decontextualized stories, which often rely on binary thinking (for example,
good vs. evil).

9. Reveal Hidden Power Relationships. Work to uncover and denaturalize power imbalances, whether they are imposed by the
settler/ruling class or from within the oppressed/colonized group itself. (Visit Chapter # 5: Feminisms for a discussion of the
ways Chicana and Latina feminists confronted patriarchy both externally and internally).

10. Personalize. Seek out the stories of everyday people as important historical actors, not simply exceptional personalities or

icons.

11. Show Connections and Context. “Just as medicinal history must restore individuality to anonymous masses of people, it

must also restore the social context to individuals singled out as the actors of history.”

12. Restore Global Context. This point is related to hemispheric/transnational and relational approaches discussed in the

previous section. Medicinal histories restore connections to the experiences, lives, histories, and cultures of others beyond
imposed imperial boundaries and borders.

13. Access and Digestibility. Medicinal histories must be made available to the people whose stories (or their ancestor's stories)
are featured in our work. What is the historians’ responsibility to the community they write about? How can you make your
work accessible to the community?

14. Show Yourself in Your Work. What is your investment in the topic/project? How are you implicated in the history that you
study? Explore your positionality and how it affects your interpretation of the topic and the evidence. What is at stake for
you personally, emotionally, and intellectually? Be transparent by naming all of this in your work.

15. Cross Borders. Be open, be curious, and make all kinds of connections: disciplinary, temporal, and spatial.

An excellent example of a medicinal history is The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History by Emma Pérez (1999).
Pérez  confronts  the  expectation  that  historians  must  remain  within  the  sanctioned  boundaries  of  the  discipline,  work  within  the
dominant systems of thought, and sustain official arguments. She argues that as a discipline, history relies on a colonial imaginary,
which  purports  to  be  objective  and  able  to  provide  definitive  answers  when  in  reality,  it  arranges  time  and  space  linearly
emphasizing origins, categories, chronologies, and periodization. These prevalent approaches reinforce colonialist historiography,
similar  to  what  Levins  Morales  calls  imperial  history,  and  have  been  utilized  by  Chicano/a  historians  to  construct  a  masculinist
Chicano historiography that has omitted or obscured women, queer, and Indigenous peoples. Pérez interrogates the construction of
accepted knowledges in general and examines the gaps in Chicano historical discourse in particular, marking a shift in Chicano/a
historiography.  To  address  her  concerns,  she  deploys  the  decolonial  imaginary,  a  new  category,  a  political  project,  and  “a
theoretical tool for uncovering the hidden voices of Chicanas that have been relegated to silences, to passivity, to that third space
where agency is enacted through third space feminism.”  The decolonial imaginary allows us to “write a history that decolonizes
otherness”  by “(en)gendering Chicano history” ––in other words, to write Chicanas into history. Pérez, like Levins Morales, is
concerned  with  processes  over  origins,  asking  questions  over  declaring  definitive  answers,  making  interventions  over
documentation,  and  speaking  self-reflectively  from  the  margins  to  reconceptualize  fragmented  histories  that  center  women  and
queer Chicanas.

Herstorical Recovery with Chicana Movidas

Other feminist historians provide additional tools for writing Chicanas/Latinas into history. ¡Chicana Power! Contested Histories
of Feminism in the Chicano Movement by Maylei Blackwell (2011) is the first and only book-length study of women’s involvement
in the Chicano movement era to date. The text makes a critical historiographic intervention by looking to the gaps in colonial and
patriarchal historical practices that continually silence and erase women. For instance, despite the historical evidence of Chicana
feminist  praxis  (thought  and  activism),  historians  of  the  U.S.  women’s  movement  and  the  Chicano  movement  have  expunged
Chicana contributions from the historical record. The act of periodization in particular erases women of color from the 1960s and
1970s. The so-called waves model, foundational in women’s studies, places women of color activism and writing as emerging in
 Chicano movement history periodization claims
the third wave, denying their participation and contributions to the second wave.
the height of the movement took place in 1968-1975 and locates Chicana feminism as occurring afterward, with some historians
arguing feminism contributed to its decline.

Consequently,  these  acts  of  ongoing  erasure  are  reflected  in  women’s  studies  and  Chicano  studies  curricula.  Moreover,  the
emphasis  on  the  great  man  narrative  in  Chicano  movement  historiography  “does  a  disservice  to  the  historical  memory  of  the
majority  of  its  participants  and  obscures  the  fact  that  the  collective  action  and  daily  acts  of  courage  of  thousands  of  everyday
people  change  the  tide  of  history.”   Utilizing  the  concept  of  retrofitted  memory,  Blackwell  interrogates  why  certain  stories
remain  untold,  uncovering  the  ways  power  functions  in  the  creation  of  truth  regimes,  in  order  to  make  space  for  women’s
(his)stories and their visions of liberation and transformation. Blackwell invites readers to “continue the historical excavation and
analysis, to chart underground stories, and to develop a better understanding of the actors who have already been recognized.”

Continuing the tradition of historical recovery and destabilization of conventional social movement historical narratives that focus
on  iconic  individual  leaders,  renowned  organizations,  and  large-scale  public  events,  Chicana  movidas  provides  a  lens  to
understand  the  everyday  strategies,  tactics,  and  relationships,  often  occurring  within  and  between  highly  visible  movements,  as
intentional and significant individual and collective liberatory maneuvers.
 These movidas are organized using a technique called
mapping movidas, which is

a mode of historical analysis that allows us to chart the small-scale, intimate political moves, gestures, and collaborations that
reflect the tactics women used to negotiate the internalities of power within broader social movements. It identifies how they
tracked  and  negotiated  multiple  scales  of  power  within  their  homes,  communities,  organizations,  social  movements,  and
dominant society. It recuperates both silenced memories and their documentary evidence to tell a story of the intimacies of
struggle,  challenging  the  knowledge/power  system  of  traditional  archival  spaces  and  methodologies.  It  looks  not  only  to
marches, meetings, and conferences but also to alternative sites of collective action: the kitchens, hallways, and living rooms
where Chicanas forged a praxis at the intersection of their identities.

By focusing on Chicana movidas, scholars are able to move beyond the confines of Chicano historiography, expanding the field’s
spatial and temporal boundaries by documenting movidas outside of the U.S. Southwest and outside of already documented major
events and actions. Chicana movidas are not limited by dominant modes of historical periodization, and as a result, studies tend to
be transgenerational. For example, Chicana lesbians such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Ana Castillo, Naomi Littlebear Moreno, and Cherríe
Moraga,  among  many  others,  often  organized  for  Chicana  or  women’s  rights  in  the  1970s  and  later  produced  Chicana  lesbian
feminist scholarship in the 1980s and 1990s, acting as a bridge between Chicana movement spaces and phases.

Chicana and Latina historians have built a robust and dynamic field over the last five decades illuminating women’s voice, agency,
and material realities. They have provided us with new intersectional and interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological tools to
read against the grain, recover subjugated knowledges, and center marginalized stories. While many important studies have been
written,  they  are  only  scratching  the  surface––there  are  unlimited  topics  to  explore  and  studies  to  produce  in  Chicana/Latina
history. The next section introduces readers to two of the many decolonial-medicinal methods that have been developed by feminist
and queer historians.

## 3.3: Embodied Memories- Archival Movidas and Oral Hxstory

Archival Movidas

During  the  Chicano  movement  era,  activists  developed  a  robust  print  culture  to  publicize  important  issues,  explore  and  debate
ideas, and connect across regions. Many Chicanas published important essays and produced photojournalism, but were often not
given credit. These “anonymous” sources are part of the Chicano movement archive, which scholars utilize to produce studies of
the era. Coupled with colonialist and patriarchal historical practices, Chicana participation in El Movimiento is often written out of
history.

Such absences in the record replicate the invisibilization of Chicana labor in the 1960s and 1970s and reinforce the need for
oral historians and researchers to talk directly to movement activists, explore extrainstitutional archives, and perhaps more
importantly,  ask  the  right  questions  of  their  sources.  More  often  than  not,  excavations  of  Chicana  memory  have  been
undertaken  from  the  ground  up,  with  scholars  tracking  down  sources,  sifting  through  personal  archives,  and  conducting
lengthy interviews and oral histories.

These archival movidas expand  what  is  typically  considered  valid  source  material  and  documentary  evidence  by  also  including
oral histories as a source of embodied knowledge, which is explored further in the remainder of this section.

In  The  Archive  and  the  Repertoire:  Performing  Cultural  Memory  in  the  Americas  (2003),  performance  studies  and  Latin/o
American studies scholar Diana Taylor calls attention to how colonial historiography creates a distance, a binary, and a hierarchy
between  “the  archive  of  supposedly  enduring  materials  (i.e.,  texts,  documents,  buildings,  bones)  and  the  so-called  ephemeral
repertoire  of  embodied  practice/knowledge  (spoken  language,  dance,  sports,  ritual).”   The  texts/objects  that  constitute  archival
memory are thought to be unmediated and remain unchanged, despite changing interpretations of them, and the repertoire is often
restricted to the past. Taylor argues that the repertoire enacts embodied memory and requires people to be present and participate in
the production and transmission of knowledge. She says that both the archive and the repertoire are mediated (people make choices
about them) and they are both important sources of information that work in tandem.

María Cotera provides fresh understandings for engaging with the archive and the repertoire as embodied sources of memory and
knowledge.  Along  with  Linda  Garcia  Merchant,  Cotera  created  the  Chicana  por  mi  Raza  Digital  Memory  Project  and  Archive
(CPMR) in 2009, collecting more than 100 oral histories of Chicana feminists from the movement era, one being her mother Marta
Cotera,  as  well  as  7,000  objects  and  materials  from  their  personal  archives  such  as  “letters,  photographs,  meeting  notes  and
agendas,  conference  programs,  out-of-print  books,  journals,  newspapers,  flyers,  posters,  buttons,  and  even  audio  recordings  and
filmstrips,” which were then digitized.
 Cotera began the project as a daughter seeking to recuperate and preserve her mother’s
personal archive, which she notes is part of a “stunningly rich constellation of largely unexplored collections that collectively haunt
the  official  archive  of  both  the  women’s  movement  and  the  Chicano  movement,  a  constellation  that  offers  its  own  disruptive
version of the past.”

She found that gathering a personal archive was a common practice among Chicana feminists, naming this phenomenon a praxis of
memory,  which  provides  “a  model  to  critically  reframe  the  relationship  between  the  past  and  the  present”  and  “new  objects  of
inquiry and new methods of analysis.”  Through her work building the CPMR, Cotera confronted the colonial emphasis on the so-
called authority of the archivist and attempts to organize the objects into a single linear narrative focusing on the product rather
than the process. She recalls,

What  we  were  collecting  wasn’t  just  bits  and  pieces  of  evidence  of  historical  presence,  but  collections  themselves,  some
small  and  carefully  curated,  some  haphazard,  some  sprawling  and  wild,  and  others  meticulously  organized  in  rows  of  file
cabinets  and  folders.  Our  developing  archive  was  something  more  than  a  collection  of  documents––it  was  a  collection  of
collections  and  recollections,  a  space  where  Chicana  memory  practices  are  both  preserved  and  performed.  [This  work
incited]  …  a  series  of  theoretical  and  methodological  questions  about  memory,  knowledge  production,  and  historical
meaning-making.  Is  it  possible  to  interrupt  erasures  of  the  archive/knowledge  system,  to  decolonize  the  archive?  Can  we
challenge  the  power  relations  between  scholars  and  their  objects  of  study  that  all  too  often  render  silent  the  multitude  of
voices and articulations that cannot be contained in a single coherent narrative? Can we create an archive that responds to the
radical potential of the memory practices it documents? Can an archive become a site/sitio of encuentro and conocimiento
rather than simply a repository––a place where new ways of producing and exchanging knowledge are explored, where new
modes of identity, affiliation, and memory are forged in the meeting place between present and past?

Cotera addressed these questions first-hand, working with students to build the CPMR archive, noting that those who access the
archival materials become historical practitioners, actively engaging with the past to critically theorize the present, moving through
a path of conocimiento.

 Key Term: Conocimiento

Conocimiento is an aspect of consciousness, a living theory, and a praxis laid out by Gloria E. Anzaldúa in her essay “now let
us shift… the path of conocimiento… inner work, public acts.”  It describes the journey one takes in the development of an
embodied self-awareness, questioning reality and dominant paradigms, and experiencing shifts in perception. Building on her
earlier  theory  of  mestiza  consciousness,  Anzaldúa  writes,  “Her  first  step  is  to  take  inventory.  Despojando,  desgranando,
quitando paja. …She puts history through a sieve, winnows out the lies, looks at the forces that we as a race, as women, have
been a part of. …She reinterprets history and, using new symbols, she shapes new myths. She adopts new perspectives toward
the darkskinned, women and queers. She strengthens her tolerance (and intolerance) for ambiguity. She is willing to share, to
make herself vulnerable to foreign ways of seeing and thinking.”  The task of the traveler, then, is to take inventory and sift
through history in order to develop new insights about the self and the world and to act on this new consciousness, moving
towards connection, liberation, and healing.

These acts of Chicana remembrance are a technology that can bridge the past and the present of Chicana feminist thought. As an
alternative  archive,  the  CPMR  attends  to  the  structured  silences  and  colonial  mechanisms  of  erasure,  moving  beyond  seeking
inclusion in official archives, questioning the collecting, documenting, and organizing logics of historical knowledge production.

Chicana feminist scholars have also become historical practitioners working with their own family archives. In “A Familial Legacy
of meXicana Style,” Chicana feminist literary and cultural studies scholar Domino Renee Perez longs for intergenerational family
photos, saying that they are a “non-portable luxury” not afforded to her migrant family.
 Despite this limitation, Perez was able to
obtain three photos of her grandmother, which led her on a journey to piece together her life story, with many questions arising
along  the  way.  She  also  gathered  photographs  from  her  mother,  aunts,  and  uncles  to  build  an  abundant  collection  of  images,
memories, and stories. Using auto-ethnography, Perez digs into her family’s and communities’ complex social history through the
practices  of  dress  and  adornment,  offering  a  historical  and  poetic  recounting  of  her  family’s  style  and  its  influence  on  her  own
identity.  Her  non-linear  narrative  jumps  back  and  forth  in  time  from  the  story  surrounding  the  photo  to  her  own  present-day
interpretations  and  feelings  about  the  encuentros with  the  photo  and  its  surrounding  memories.  Perez  presents  the  immigration
history of her family, the class divisions among Latinas/os at the turn of the twentieth century, and the buying patterns of Latinas/os
as they struggle with constructing identity through self-adornment and intersectional oppression through the impositions of social
class, ethnicity, gender, and race.

Oral Hxstory

Through  storytelling,  testimonios,  and  oral  history  interviews  conducted  in  the  late  1990s  with  translatina  singer,  performance
artist, and Bay Area, California icon Teresita la Campesina, queer Latino oral historian Horacio Roque Ramírez further expands
our understandings of the archive. Ramírez documents Teresita’s life history, which represents “a living archive of evidence that
responds to both the whiteness of queer archiving practices and the heteronormativity of Latino historiography.”  As a translatina
elder who lived through the second half of the twentieth century (1940-2002), the later part of her life with AIDS, Teresita was,
“Deeply committed to laying out a living historical record of queer desires,” assuming “responsibility to pass on the stories and
histories  of  the  fallen,  those  who  came  before  the  current  generations  of  queer  Latina/o  community  builders.”   Through  the
example of Teresita’s communal and intergenerational narratives connected to the larger socio-political landscape of San Francisco,
Ramírez challenges us to think about individual memories not merely as objects to collect, but as deeply social living testimony.

Ramírez was impacted by Teresita’s presence as a queer Latinx historical anchor and a living archive of desire, meaning, the body
itself  holds  memories,  knowledge,  “sexual  consciousness,  erotic  desire,  and  gender  expression.”   He  wrote  about  the  profound
exchange between them and his concerns as a queer oral historian, listener, and witness. Over time, they became collaborators who
built a relationship based on trust. “That she trusted me in her final years of life also meant that she set a responsibility for me to do
something with the archive she was revealing,” Ramírez writes.
 Maylei Blackwell contends that oral history can be understood as
an embodied knowledge practice for both the narrator and the witness/researcher. Expressions and interactions may not be captured
in the transcript––connections and relationships are developed and additional meanings are conveyed “off tape.” Chicana/o/x and
Latina/o/x  feminist  and  queer  oral  historians  often  develop  long-term  collaborations  with  their  narrators,  which  can  grow  into
friendships  and/or  political  commitments,  leading  to  deeper  knowledge  and  higher  levels  of  accountability.  That  Ramírez  was

explicit about these intimate and vulnerable moments as a graduate student researcher provides a fruitful example for those of us
who wish to use oral history and testimonio to gather stories from our beloved communities.

Ramírez’s work is instrumental in the development of queer oral history methods and queer Latinx archives, particularly those that
document the lives, embodied memories, and histories of those impacted by the AIDS epidemic. Like other scholars discussed in
this chapter, Ramírez poses a set of questions in Bodies of Evidence: The Practice of Queer Oral History (2012), along with his co-
author Nan Alamilla Boyd, that create additional openings in Chicanx/Latinx historiography:

How has queer oral history evolved? Are queer methods different from other oral history methods? What has it meant for
narrators to talk openly with researchers about queer life, especially when queer genders, sexualities, and desires have been
protectively hidden or vowed to secrecy? What has it meant for researchers to focus their work on queer history?

These  questions  can  provide  an  important  starting  point  for  those  who  wish  to  collect  queer  Chicanx/Latinx  oral  hxstories  and
testimonios, which are critical acts of documentation and oppositional histories that “provide alternative perspectives to the course
of  history  and  its  archives”  that  quite  literally  speak  back  to  historical  absences  through  the  creation  of  new  materials  and  new
 While many queer oral history projects have been developed over the past decades, similar to Chicana/Latina feminist
records.

## 3.4: Literary Histories

Chicanx and Latinx Literature as History

In  Literature  as  History:  Autobiography,  Testimonio,  and  the  Novel  in  the  Chicano  and  Latino  Experience  (2016),  Chicano
historian  Mario  T.  García  proposes  what  the  title  of  his  book  suggests––that  Chicanx  and  Latinx  literature  is  history,  including
fictional texts, autobiographies, testimonios (oral history) and novels, each possessing a “historical context and therefore speaking
to  their  historical  period.”   Similarly,  Louis  Gerard  Mendoza,  professor  of  Latina/o  literary  and  cultural  studies,  argues  the
literature of Mexican descent people in the U.S. has represented the past using fiction and non-fiction, pointing out that a polarity
exists between history, which is understood as real/factual, and literature, which is understood as imagined/possible. According to
Mendoza and García, Chicanx literature blurs these lines––a text can be both historical and literary. In other words, “…people of
Mexican descent in the United States do not have simply a history on the one hand and a literature on the other; we also have that
history expressed in literary form.”  Moreover, “literature can offer imaginative reconstructions of possible events, occurrences,
and  interactions  that  are  historically  informed.”   This  means  that  Chicanx/Latinx  literature  can  be  examined  as  historical
documents and read for insights into Chicanx/Latinx history. Mendoza addresses the following questions in his study––questions
that would be productive if discussed in the classroom: “Can literature help in recovering the political/social history of Chicanas/os
without distorting it or reducing it to ‘mere fiction?’ Can it render the past differently—that is, more complexly—than ‘history’
can? What can it add? Is it better able to capture the nuances of intercultural relations and intracultural conflict?”

An important contribution to understanding and utilizing literature as history has been the Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary
Heritage project, which began in the 1990s to recover, digitize, and make accessible hundreds of thousands of Spanish literary texts
and English-language texts written by Latinxs including novels, poetry, chronicles, memoirs, photographs, and essays as well as
primary source documents and newspapers dating back to the earliest encounters between Hispanic and Indigenous peoples in what
would become the United States. Editors of The Routledge Companion to Latino/a Literature (2013) Suzanne Bost and Frances R.
Aparicio  remark,  “Recovery  projects  make  available  texts  that  were  ‘lost’  due  to  lack  of  readership  (or  sometimes  outright
censorship)  but  have  been  ‘found’  and  republished  as  Latino/a  literature  became  increasingly  popular  in  and  after  the  1980s.”
According to the project's program director Nicolás Kanellos,

Recovering  the  U.S.  Hispanic  Literary  Heritage  aspires  to  recover  all  written  culture,  not  just  literature,  and  it  intends  to
restore to local and national institutions what was lost or suppressed during the ethnocentric and racial construction of the
nation  through  such  ideologies  and  practices  as  manifest  destiny,  slavery,  segregation,  and  capitalist  construction  of  the
government  and  the  economy.  It  recognizes  that  United  States  Latino  culture  has  developed  over  a  period  of  some  five
centuries––not counting the indigenous history that existed before the encounter with Europeans and became part of Latino
culture.

Commenting  on  the  social  and  political  implications  of  the  project,  Kanellos  echoes  the  sentiments  of  other  scholar-activists
featured in this chapter, claiming,

Studying ideologies of racial and cultural superiority like manifest destiny also helps us to understand why little care was
taken to recognize and preserve an archive of Hispanic texts and knowledge as the United States expanded southward and
westward  and  began  receiving  large  waves  of  Spanish-speaking  immigrants.  Simply  stated,  and  repeated  many  times  in
postcolonial studies, an empire does not and cannot acknowledge as civilized the peoples it has conquered or incorporated;
most of the archives, libraries, museums, universities, and schools that were established in the newly incorporated lands and
in the labor camps of the East, Midwest, Southwest, and Florida did not collect and preserve the written and oral culture––
newspapers, books, documents, spoken word––of natives, immigrants, and refugees, for to do so would have destroyed the
Anglo-Americans’  claim  of  superiority  and,  thus,  of  the  right  to  dominate  Latinos  while  denying  them  theoretical  and
practical inclusion in their nation, as they defined it.

As this section has demonstrated, the recovery, documentation, preservation, and dissemination of Chicanx/Latinx literature is an
important component in the larger objective of Chicanx/Latinx history to revise, recast, and correct historical narratives that shape
our present-day lives.

 Sidebar: Caballero: A Historical Novel

Co-authored by Jovita González and Eve Raleigh (Margaret Eimer’s pseudonym), Caballero: A Historical Novel was written
in the 1930s and early 1940, but was not published until 1996. After early failed attempts to publish the manuscript and being
lost for decades, the novel was rediscovered in the Jovita González and Edmundo E. Mireles papers that were archived at the
Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi library in the early 1990s. The manuscript was identified by Professor José E. Limón
who, with María Eugenia Cotera, edited the novel for publication. According to the publisher, Caballero, “centers on a mid-
nineteenth-century  Mexican  landowner  and  his  family  living  in  the  heart  of  southern  Texas  during  a  time  of  tumultuous
change. After covering the American military occupation of South Texas, the story involves the reader in romances between
young lovers from opposing sides during the military conflict of the U.S.-Mexico War. The young protagonists fall in love but
face  struggles  with  race,  class,  gender,  and  sexual  contradictions.  This  work,  long  lost  in  a  collection  of  private  papers  and
unavailable until now, serves as a literary ethnography of South Texas-Mexican folklore customs and traditions as well as a
feminist critique of rigid patriarchal culture.”

Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Heritage project has recovered the works of women including Amparo Ruiz de Burton,
Luisa Capetillo, Adina de Zavala, María Cristina Mena, Leonor Villegas de Magnón, and Jovita González. In a keynote speech
titled  “The  Construction  of  Latina  Agency  in  Early  Southwest  Literature,”  Dr.  Rosaura  Sánchez  points  to  the  ways  these
authors portray their women characters as having agency, but that agency is tied to being a wife or daughter of an upper-class
ranchero.  While  Caballero  and  others  like  it  are  valuable  texts,  Sánchez  cautions  those  of  us  searching  for  a  past  literary
heritage  to  be  aware  of  an  author’s  positionality  and  not  assume  that  a  Spanish  surname  equates  to  being  a  supporter  of
marginalized  members  of  one’s  community  or  critical  of  oppressive  social  structures  and  institutions.  Sánchez  asserts,
“Recovery need not be uncritically celebratory; even archaeological digs run their recovered artifacts through sieves or filters
to determine the artifact’s authenticity or relevance. …Ours is in large measure a history of violence and dispossession and for
that reason it is important to construct our past critically. Recover we must, but with a critical perspective to point to the spatial
and discursive violence that has been and to some degree continues to characterize our histories.”

## 3.5: Conclusion

Summary

In  this  chapter,  we  defined  what  Chicanx/Latinx  history  is  and  covered  the  ways  the  field  disrupts  dominant  conventions  in  the
discipline  of  history  through  the  usage  of  anti-imperial,  anti-racist,  decolonial,  and  medicinal  approaches  and  methods.  The
contributions of feminist and queer studies scholars were highlighted, along with other activist scholars, who are working to expand
and deepen the field of Chicanx/Latinx history.

Many scholars express the need for Chicanx/Latinx history to be made available beyond the college classroom and shared with the
wider public through K-12 curricula, public educational programs, mass media, and other venues of public history. One way this is
taking place is through Chicanx/Latinx expressive oral culture, which has been a vital method of meaning-making and knowledge-
sharing for centuries. Oral traditions such as storytelling, music (especially corridos), and testimonio are used to pass on familial
and cultural histories across generations and geographies. Visual culture, murals in particular, have also been used as an accessible
means  to  publicly  document  and  exhibit  Chicanx/Latinx  history  (visit  Section  10.5:  Cultural  Productions  in  Practice  for  a
discussion of this topic). As this chapter has demonstrated, there are still many stories to document and historical studies to conduct
and we hope that you are inspired to engage in this important work.

Ancillary materials for this chapter are located in Section ## 11.3: Chapter 3 Resource Guide, which includes slides, media, writing
and discussion prompts, and suggested assignments and activities.

Key Terms

Historiography: The study of the ways a group, culture, or discipline constructs its history.

Hemispheric Approach: An approach used by scholars in the field of Chicanx/Latinx history to examine transnational histories of
the Americas, beyond national, regional, or even continental borders, accounting for the ways that power structures race, culture,
gender,  sexuality,  and  resources  across  time  and  space.  It  emphasizes  thinking  beyond  borders  that  contain  the  nation-state  and
expanding the scope and frameworks many U.S. historians rely on. A hemispheric lens also allows for an expansive examination of
mobile commodities, ideas, and peoples in diaspora that flow across imperial geographies.

Borderlands  Theory:  This  theory,  developed  by  Gloria  Anzaldúa,  challenges  imposed  nation-state  borders  and  provides  new
frames  for  understanding  identity,  hybridity,  and  the  material  realities  of  people  who  reside  in  the  b/Borderlands,  extending  the
notion  of  a  geopolitical  border  in  order  to  explore  the  boundaries  of  gender,  sexuality,  spirituality,  language,  and  other  social
locations,  dislocations,  and  encounters.  This  theory  would  become  foundational  for  Chicanx/Latinx  historians  who  utilize  a
hemispheric approach to history.

Thematic  Approach:  An  approach  to  history  that  focuses  on  key  concepts  and  themes  such  as  empire,  conquest,  wars  of
expansion, and revolution; migration and nation-building; industrialization and labor; and civil rights and resistance movements,
among others, from the perspective of Latinx populations.

Relational  Approach:  The  study  of  how  one  racial  group  is  affected  by  the  ways  another  group  is  racialized  through  co-
constitutive  historical,  social,  and  political  processes.  Rather  than  studying  a  racially  marginalized  group  in  contrast  to  white
supremacist  and  colonial  power  structures  exclusively,  a  relational  approach  moves  beyond  a  white/nonwhite  binary  to  examine
racially subordinated groups in relation to one another. A relational view does not advocate for simply comparing and contrasting
groups’ experiences, viewing them independently. Rather, groups are understood to be interdependent.

Imperial Histories: Narratives manufactured official histories wielded by a colonizing power or repressive regime “to attack the
sense  of  history  of  those  they  wish  to  dominate  and  attempt  to  take  over  and  control  people’s  relationship  to  their  own  past.”
Imperial histories are created to justify and explain oppressive power imbalances by naturalizing them, making them seem inherent
and permanent.

Curandera  Historian:  A  person  who  works  to  heal  the  damage  caused  by  imperial  histories.  They  work  to  restore  the
dehistoricized sense of identity and possibility of colonized and oppressed peoples.

Medicinal  Histories:  What  curandera  historians  produce.  Medicinal  histories  re-establish  the  connections  between  peoples  and
their  histories,  revealing  the  mechanisms  of  power  by  which  their  current  condition  of  oppression  was  achieved  as  well  as  the
multiplicity, creativity, and persistence of resistance among the oppressed.

Colonial Imaginary: The epistemology, or way of knowing, that the dominant discipline of history relies on. Time and space are
arranged  linearly  and  origins,  categories,  chronologies,  and  periodization  is  emphasized.  These  prevalent  approaches  reinforce  a
colonialist historiography, which have omitted or obscured women, queer, and Indigenous peoples’ stories.

Decolonial Imaginary: A new category, a political project, and a theoretical tool developed by Emma Pérez to counter the colonial
imaginary by writing Chicanas into the historical record.

Retrofitted Memory: A concept developed by Maylei Blackwell to interrogate why certain stories remain untold, uncovering the
ways  power  functions  in  the  creation  of  truth  regimes,  in  order  to  make  space  for  women’s  (his)stories  and  their  visions  of
liberation and transformation.

Chicana  Movidas:  A  lens  to  understand  the  everyday  strategies,  tactics,  and  relationships,  often  occurring  within  and  between
highly visible movements, as intentional and significant individual and collective liberatory maneuvers.

Mapping Movidas: The technique used to organize Chicana movidas. It is a mode of historical analysis that charts the small-scale,
intimate  political  moves,  gestures,  and  collaborations  that  reflect  the  tactics  women  used  to  negotiate  multiple  scales  of  power
within their homes, communities, organizations, social movements, and dominant society.

Archival Movidas: Expand what is typically considered valid source material and documentary evidence by also including oral
histories and extrainstitutional archives as a source of embodied knowledge.

Praxis of Memory: A term that describes the ways in which Chicana feminists compile a personal archive of personal objects and
materials, creating a space where Chicana memory practices are both preserved and performed.

Conocimiento: An aspect of consciousness, a living theory, and a praxis laid out by Gloria E. Anzaldúa. It describes the journey
one takes in the development of an embodied self-awareness, questioning reality and dominant paradigms, and experiencing shifts
in perception.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 4: Indigeneities

 Learning Objectives

Recognize theories and knowledge produced by Chicanx and Latinx Indigenous communities to describe critical events,
histories, traditions, and social struggles, emphasizing agency and group affirmation.
Identify and assess how struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation among Chicanx and Latinx
Indigenous folks of the Americas are relevant to current and structural issues such as immigration, settler-colonialism,
multiculturalism, and language policies.
Describe and actively engage with anti-racist and anti-colonial issues and the practices and movements in Chicanx and
Latinx Indigenous communities to build a just and equitable society.

Introduction

(cid:0)   Content  Warning:  Physical  Violence  and  Sexual  Violence.  Please  note  that  this  chapter  includes  discussions  of  physical  and
sexual violence.

This  chapter  explores  the  themes  of  Indigeneity  and  migration  as  they  affect  social,  cultural,  and  political  intra-and-inter  group
dynamics among Chicanx and Indigenous Latinx communities native to the Americas and Indigenous to this hemisphere. By intra-
and-inter-group dynamics, we mean between and across groups, which considers global political economies and social dynamics.
This complexity requires the use of a transnational framework to look beyond rigid historical narratives of nation and Indigenous
identity.

Chicanx and Indigenous Latinx peoples are affected by the legacy and ongoing violence of colonialism, attempted genocide against
Native Americans by  Europeans,  contemporary  issues  of  land  displacement  (especially  in  Central  America  and  Mexico),  harsh
immigration policies, and militarized enforcement strategies. These systems intersect, and by examining them in-depth, we observe
the tradition of people’s movement across land and water, establishing contact between groups and navigating power relationships.

Each section in this chapter provides a closer look at the concepts, histories, intersections, and complexity of Chicanx and Latinx
Indigeneities.  In  the  first  section,  you  will  learn  more  about  the  conceptual  frameworks,  terms,  and  definitions  that  inform  our
understanding of Indigeneity, migration, and racialized ethnic identity. This foundation guides our next section, which more closely
examines  the  historical  and  political  background  facing  Chicanx  and  Indigenous  Latinx  peoples  today.  These  perspectives  cut
across human experiences and intersect with gender, sexuality, and race. This topic is the subject of the third section. In the fourth
section, you will learn more about how Chicanx and Latinx Indigenous experiences intersect with sexuality, gender, and migration,
including the gendered treatment of Indigenous women and social norms facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-
Spirit, and similarly identified LGBTQ2S+ people.

This  chapter  provides  a  window  into  the  social  struggles  that  motivate  activism  among  Chicanxs  and  Indigenous  Latinxs  for
cultural sovereignty, racial justice, decolonization of knowledge, and the production of cultural affirmation, resilience, and strong
communities  in  the  face  of  external  threats  and  systemic  oppression.  Understanding  these  lessons  can  help  us  realize  more
opportunities to stand up against injustice in our diverse communities.

Decolonization refers to the multiple processes of resistance that work to end the dynamics of colonialism and establish, restore,
and  defend  Indigenous  sovereignty.  It  is  important  to  note  that  decolonization  is  a  political  process  that  refers  specifically  to
Indigenous sovereignty. It is not a general term that captures all forms of social justice.

 Poetry Spotlight: In Lak'ech

This poem, “In Lak’ech,” is a philosophy rooted in Indigenous worldviews emphasizing interconnectedness, love, and respect,
acknowledging life and community in the Anahuac (Mesoamerica) region in the oral tradition of Mayan culture, which was
written by Chicano playwright and activist Luis Valdez. It is sometimes used in teaching Chicanx and Latinx studies courses.

Tú eres mi otro yo.
(You are my other me.)
Si te hago daño a ti,
(If I do harm to you,)
Me hago daño a mi mismo.
(I do harm to myself.)
Si te amo y respeto,
(If I love and respect you,)
Me amo y respeto yo.
(I love and respect myself.)

## 4.1: Concepts for Understanding Chicanx and Latinx Indigeneities

Core Definitions: Chicanx and Latinx Indigeneities

Indigeneity  is  a  broad  term  that  refers  to  a  sense  of  belonging  and  ongoing  ties  among  people  from  a  shared  homeland  that
originated  before  colonization.  It  is  essential  to  understand  the  distinctions  between  Chicanx,  Xicanx,  Indigenous  Latinx,  and
Latinx Indigenites. Indigenous Chicanx is a self-defined identity category signifying Indigeneity and awareness of their historical
roots in this hemisphere, including Anahuac (Mesoamerica). Xicanx is a preferred identity term among some Chicanxs involved in
Indigenous movements. “Chi” produces the same sound as “Xi,” but “Chi” is the Spanishpronunciation, and “Xi” is the Indigenous
one.

Indigenous  Latinx  is  an  umbrella  term  for  Indigenous  migrants  to  the  United  States  from  South  and  Central  America,  the
Caribbean, and Mexico (for example, Maya, Mixteco, Purépecha, Taino, Zapoteco, etc.). They are members of Indigenous pueblos
or nations with traditional languages, customs, responsibilities to tribal communities, sensibilities, and dispositions. These identity
labels were first introduced in Section ## 2.1: Defining Latinx Demographics.

To  understand  the  lived  experience  of  Indigenous  Latinx  peoples  examined  in  this  chapter,  we  rely  on  the  work  of  Maylei
Blackwell, Boj Lopez, and Luis Urrieta, who define Critical Latinx Indigeneities (CLI) as an analytic framework that addresses
how  Indigeneity  is  produced  differentially  by  multiple  colonialities  present  on  Indigenous  land,  where  different  Indigenous
diasporas exist in a shared space and is used to “critique enduring colonial logics and practices that operate from different localities
of  power  as  well  as  the  physical,  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  psychological  violence  that  often  targets  Indigenous  Latinx
peoples,  including  forms  of  state  and  police  violence,  cultural  appropriation,  economic  exploitation,  gender  violence,  social
exclusion, and psychological abuse.”  CLI refuses the ways migration scholars overlook the ‘‘receiving countries’’ as Indigenous
territories  and  nations.  Thus,  Critical  Latinx  Indigeneities  works  against  the  erasure  of  the  Indigenous  People.  CLI  examines
mobility as a global Indigenous process of displacement and considers the shifts in racial formations and how Indigenous people
are racialized differently across and between different settler states.

This perspective challenges Chicanx and Latinx studies to uproot ideologies in broader society, especially as they are reproduced
through  narrow  definitions  of  Latinidad,  as  introduced  in  Section  2.1:  Defining  Latinx  Demographics.  For  instance,  Lopez  and
Urrieta  say  that  the  ideology  of  Indigenismo  deployed  during  the  Chicano  movement  is  an  “Aztec-centric  celebration  of  the
Indigenous past of the nation, which often serves to erase the present and future of the sixty-three Indigenous pueblos of Mexico”
and the millions of Indigenous peoples living around the world. Others, like Tomas Perez, Jennie Luna, and Susy Zepeda, dispute
that Indigenismo is only tied to Aztec culture and instead consider Indigenismo as promoting the various Indigenous pueblos for a
growing  sense  of  empowerment.  This  was  observed  in  the  case  of  Mexican  President  Larezo  Cardenas  when  he  provided
institutional support to promote the culture, art, and history of many Indigenous Mexican tribes during his administration, which
was not limited to Mexica Aztec. The various approaches to Indigenous identity are the subject of inquiry for Indigenous Chicanx
and Latinx scholars.

 Organization Spotlight: Chicanx and Latinx Indigenous Scholars

The Indigenous Peoples/Indigenous Knowledges Caucus has been a part of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano
Studies  (NACCS)  since  the  mid-1990s  and  was  formed  with  much  struggle  to  recognize  Indigenous  roots.  The  caucus  was
established  in  response  to  the  Zapatista  uprising  and  Indigenous  social  movements,  reminding  the  world  of  the  presence  of
Indigenous  people  in  the  Americas.  Participating  scholars  have  contributed  to  scholarship  for  understanding  Chicanx  and
Latinx Indigeneities in relationship to identity, foodways, land displacement, social movements, and futurities across borders. It
was  founded  by  Roberto  Cintli  Rodríguez,  Jennie  Luna,  Roberto  Hernández,  Patrisia  Gonzales,  Gabriel  Estrada,  and  Steve
Casanova, and then led by Ernesto Tlahuitollini Colín, Robert Muñoz, Devon Peña, Melissa Moreno, Susy Zepeda, and others.
Some caucus members are displayed in Figure 4.1.1 at a NACCS conference.

Indigenous Roots in Chicanx and Latinx Communities

Tienes el nopal en la frente (You have the cactus on your forehead) – dicho

This common and harmful saying means you are Indigenous or “look” Indigenous but are attempting to hide it. It is often used to
refer  to  a  self-hating  person  who  appears  to  “clearly”  look  Indigenous  but  refuses  to  self-identify  as  Indigenous  or  with  their
Indigenous  roots  in  any  way.  It  is  a  saying  that  is  commonly  known  among  members  of  Indigenous  Chicanx  and  Latinx
communities.  The  common  nature  of  this  saying  identifies  how  anti-Indigneous  sentiments  are  part  of  sustained  socio-cultural
assumptions.

Like  race  and  ethnicity,  a  sense  of  Indigeneity  is  constructed  through  cultural  norms,  shared  group  formations,  communities,
institutions, and families. Indigeneity is also often recognized and policed through phenotype, with individuals with darker skin and
features associated with local Indigenous peoples being more likely to be visibly associated with stereotypes and cultural scripts
about Indigenous people. However, Indigeneity is also constructed through systems of sovereignty, traditional knowledge, mutual
recognition, and intergenerational kinship.

Indigenous peoples maintain and promote traditional languages, knowledge, and customs into the contemporary era. In the lands
referred to as North America and Latin America, the Indigenous peoples have used names like Isla Tortuga / Turtle Island, referring
to  the  North  American  continent;  Abya  Yala,  referring  to  southern  Mexico  and  Central  America;  and  Pachamama,  referring  to
South America. Indigenous people are also an active part of the culture, politics, and history of island societies in the Caribbean,
such  as  the  Arawak-speaking  Taino  people.  These  are  regional  solidarities  that  demonstrate  the  interconnected  and  globally
conscious perspectives embedded in Indigenous communities.

In Figure 4.1.2, a visual representation is displayed with the percentage of Indigenous people living in Latin American countries
today, which totals 46 million across the region and ranges from 0.2% in El Salvador to 62.2% in Bolivia. Guatemala follows this
at  41%,  Peru  at  24%,  and  Mexico  at  15.1%.  There  are  over  800  recognized  Indigenous  groups  in  Latin  America,  with  the  most
significant  number  of  distinct  Indigenous  peoples  residing  in  Brazil,  with  over  300  different  Indigenous  peoples  represented.
Scholars also estimate that 200 or more groups operate actively but do not seek state or federal recognition.

The labels on the chart read: Indigenous Peoples in Latin America. By the year 2010, an estimated 45 million Indigenous people
lived in Latin America, accounting for 8.3 % of the region’s population. The United Nations has championed the promotion of their
rights  by  using  different  resources  and  special  regulations  for  this  purpose.  At  present,  there  are  826  Indigenous  peoples.  An
additional 200 are estimated to be living in voluntary isolation.

In the chart, the countries are labeled by their name, percentage of Indigenous people out of the total population, and Total number
of Indigenous population. They are Mexico, 15.1%, 17 million, Honduras 7%, 537,000, Panama 12.3%, 420,000, Colombia, 3.4%,
1.6  million,  Venezuela,  2.7%  725,000,  Brazil,  0.5%,  900,000,  Bolivia,  62.2%,  6.2  million,  Paraguay,  1.8%,  113,000,  Uruguay,
2.4%, 77,000, Argentina, 2.4%, 955,000, Chile, 11%, 1.8 million, Peru, 24%, 7 million, Ecuador, 7%, 1 million, Costa Rica, 2.4%,
105,000, Nicaragua, 8.9%, 520,000, El Salvador, 0.2%, 14,500, Guatemala, 41%, 5.9 million.

Additionally,  the  captions  included  read:  “The  countries  with  the  greatest  number  of  Indigenous  peoples  are:  Brazil,  Colombia,
102, Peru 85, Mexico 78, Bolivia, 39.” and “Many Indigenous peoples are in danger of physical or cultural disappearance: Brazil,
70, Colombia, 35, Bolivia, 13.”

And the chart is summarized with the text, “ECLAC encourages the region’s countries to put public policies in practice which: 1)
are based on standards of Indigenous people’s rights, 2) include their perspectives and contributions to the region’s development, 3)
consolidate  improvements  in  their  well-being  and  living  conditions,  political  participation  and  territorial  rights,  4)  promote  the
construction of multicultural societies that benefit us all.”

Indigenous Identities: Terminology and Definitions

Various  creation  stories  are  associated  with  distinct  Indigenous  peoples  and  nations  and  tribes  of  the  Western  Hemisphere,
reflecting the diversity of the land and peoples. Some peoples whose homelands are now occupied by the United States include
peoples the Haudenosaunee (Peoples of the Longhouse, also known as the Six Nations), Diné (also known as Navajo), Istichata
(also known as Muskogee or Creek), and Siksikaitsitapi (also known as Blackfoot). In the lands now occupied by Latin America
and  the  Caribbean,  this  includes  groups  like  the  Mexica  Aztec  Nation,  Maya,  Zapotec,  Purépecha,  Mixteco,  Mapuche  Peoples,
Guarani  Peoples,  and  many  more  across  the  Southwest,  Southeast,  Caribbean  Basin,  Amazon  Basin.  Indigenous  people  have
distinct  names  and  histories,  which  include  contact,  trade,  conflict,  and  more.  There  are    differences  and  diversity  among  these
Indigenous groups, including traditions, language, religion, political organization, and more.  However, despite these differences,
Indigenous  groups  across  the  western  hemisphere  share  the  experience  of  various  European  invasions  and  colonization,  and
resisting and adapting to preserve culture, heritage, and identity.

As  a  label,  the  word  Indigenous  is  “used  to  describe  peoples  who  existed  before  colonization  and  can  be  used  to  describe  the
Indigenous peoples of the Americas.”  Always use the capital I: “Indigenous” to designate the term as a proper noun. By contrast,
the word Indian by itself “connotes the history of settlers perpetuating genocide … While there are many individuals who use the
term  “Indian”  to  describe  themselves,  particularly  when  among  their  own  in-group,  it  is  often  seen  as  offensive  for  non-Native
individuals to use this term.”  “The terms “American Indian,” “Native American,” “First Nations,” or simply “Native” are seen as
more respectful.”  Specifically, American Indian and Native American refer to Indigenous peoples of the lands currently occupied
by the United States. First Nations is most frequently used by Indigenous people in Canada. Many individuals and communities
primarily associate their identity with a specific tribal group or nation, like Chumash, Salinan, Purépecha, or Mixteco, rather than a
general category.

For Chicanxs, in the 1960s, Aztlán was considered the name of a homeland in the area now known as the Greater Southwest in the
United States. The claim to the Greater Southwest by Chicanxs in the 1960s is troubling because it overlooks the past and present
existence of Native tribal nations living in the regions in these areas, who were colonized by the Spanish before becoming part of
Mexico, and then the United States. The idea that Chicanxs had a rightful claim to the land is contradicted by the Nahua paradigm,
which states that the meaning of Aztlán is not a physical homeland but rather a body of water that needs stewardship, from which
ancestors of Chicanxs today migrated. This emphasizes the liberatory and transformative potential embedded in the idea of Aztlán,
which  is  focused  on  antiracism,  self-empowerment,  and  solidarity  among  Indigenous  peoples.  As  well,  many  individuals  and
communities  can  trace  their  lineage  to  both  Indigenous  Latinx  and  Native  American  tribes,  who  had  regular  contact,  trade,  and
cultural exchange in the region for centuries.

 Historical Spotlight: Last Message on Education (August 12, 1521)

According to oral tradition, this is the last message by the Governing Council of Mexico Tenochtitlan, given by Cuauhtémoc as
his last act of government on August 12, 1521. The message is about the importance of Indigenous parents teaching children
traditions in the home, even during an invasion.

Our Sun has gone down

Our Sun has hidden its face

and has left us in complete darkness

But we know it will return again

that it will rise again

to light us anew

But while it is there in

the Mansion of Silence

Very soon will we join together and embrace each other

and in the very center of our being hide

all that

our hearts love

and we know is the Great Treasure.

We will destroy all of our temples to the Principal Creator,

our schools, our sacred ball game

our youth centers

our houses of song and play

Our streets will remain abandoned

Our homes will enclose us

until our New Sun rises.

Most honorable fathers and mothers,

may you never forget to guide your young

and teach your children while you live

how good it has been until now our beloved Anahuac

sheltered and protected our destiny

and for our great respect and good behavior

confirmed by our ancestors

and our parents enthusiastically received

and seeded in our being.

Now we will instruct our children

how good it will be, they will raise themselves up

and gain strength

and how good it will be to achieve their great destiny

in this, our beloved motherland of Anahuac.

Mestizaje and the Intersection of Indigeneity and Race

Stories of heritage among Chicanxs and Indigenous Latinxs vary on their past and present ties to their homelands. Mestizas/os/xs
are a diverse population that has a combination of mixed heritage, often including Indigenous lineage, along with a combination of
African  and/or  European  backgrounds.  Across  these  diverse  groups,  some  have  experienced  contemporary  forced  acculturation,
and others have been taught to believe they can assimilate and be invested in the dominant Spanish or Anglo-American cultural
ways. The investment in whiteness is sometimes experienced through colorism when children are born, as they may be referred to
as being a güerita/o or morenita/o if they have light or dark skin. Children’s light skin may be celebrated guided by the belief that
they may eventually pass as white, which leads to identity conflict and pressure throughout development. Even the term “mestiza”
or “mestizo” is sometimes used to assert a hierarchy between individuals of mixed heritage compared to Indigenous peoples with
no Europaean (or African) heritage.

The idea of mestizaje, or mixed-race identity, emphasizes the multiple lineages that not only shape individual identity, but also the
communities, cultures, languages, and traditions that we practice. José Vasconcelos Calderón called mestizos la raza cosmica (“the
cosmic race”). However, an overemphasis on the mixing of various groups in Latin America can be used to create a false sense of
equality  that  is  not  reflected  in  the  actual  conditions  of  racialized  groups  in  Latin  America,  the  United  States,  and  Canada.  In
particular, Mexico and Brazil have both promoted a sense of national unity that attempts to erase differences based on race, color,
and Indigeneity.  For communities experiencing the effects of inter-generational oppression, segregation, and exploitation, the idea
that all ethnic differences have fused in a post-racial society erases the realities of inequity and the importance of advocates calling
for justice. For Indigenous peoples, reductive deployments of ethnic categorization can disrupt attempts for collective liberation.

Marginalization continues through everyday stereotypes and myths about Indigenous people taught in various institutions, such as
schools, mass media, and policy. As an example of anti-Indigenous oppression among Chicanx and Latinx people, we may hear

pejorative terms like “India Maria” and “Oaxaquita,” signifying a connotation of inferiority. Community responsive efforts, like in
Ventura California, have included the “No me llames Oaxaquita” campaign, which translates into “do not call me little Oxacca.”
This  effort  created  greater  awareness  about  how  this  harmful  term  can  negatively  impact  young  people  and  their  communities,
motivating people to question their own biases and assumptions. Social movements have always been important for responding to
the marginalization and direct threats to the lives of Indigenous peoples. Movement mobilization includes calling for sovereignty,
treaty rights, resistance to Columbus Day and triumphalist narratives in history, stopping environmental destruction, water rights,
cultural revitalization, land acknowledgment, and more. A land acknowledgment is a formal statement recognizing and respecting
Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of the land as well as the historical relationship between Indigenous Peoples and their
traditional territories.

Latinidad has also been critiqued for the ways that it calls for an overriding unity between all Latinx, Latina, and Latino people.
These  generalizations  tend  to  benefit  the  most  privileged  within  this  group,  including  cisgender,  heterosexual,  male,  English-
speaking,  light-skinned  or  white,  citizen  Latinos.  For  this  reason,  some  groups  who  are  multiply  marginalized  within  the  Latinx
community have called against using this term, or qualifying it.
 Others have modified the term, including through the label, Afro-
Latinx, which describes people from Latin America of African descent. For a refresher on Latinidad and Afro-Latinidad, you can
return to Section 2.2: (Re)constructing Latinidades.

The  histories  and  identities  of  Afro-descendant  people  and  Indigenous  peoples  in  the  Americas  have  been  interacting  and
intertwined for centuries. For example, the Garifuna people are of mixed African and Indigenous heritage from the island called St.
Vincent. Members and descendants of this group exist across Central America, the Caribbean, and the United States, and are just
one example of the strength and pride that has been built through solidarity with African and Indigenous heritage.

  and  also  more
Afro-Latinxs  are  more  likely  to  experience  discrimination  and  policing  in  the  United  States  than  other  Latinxs,
  Within  Latinx  communities,  dynamics  of  racism  and
likely  to  raise  these  issues  within  Latinx  communities  more  broadly.
colorism work to silence Afro-Latinx voices and discourage inclusive participation. Racial categorization in places like Brazil tends
to  be  closely  layered  with  colorism,  leading  to  vastly  different  experiences  of  racial  norms  and  consequences,  even  within
biological families, based on one’s physical presentation of race.

 This  suggests  that  the
In  the  United  States,  self-identified  Afro-Latinxs  make  up  nearly  25%  of  the  total  Hispanic  population.
concerns of Afro-Latinx people are more central to both Black and Latinx cultures than is typically represented in popular media or
social movements. For example, Black feminism often credits the development of major theoretical traditions like intersectionality
to African-American women in the United States. However, when considering transnational Black communities, there have been
theoretical  and  conceptual  developments  in  places  like  Brazil  that  serve  as  roots  of  contemporary  intersectional  feminist
movements. Recognizing these mutual sources of inspiration and activist mobilization is an opportunity for transnational coalitions
and mutual learning. For example, Angela Davis has made a practice of collaborating with Black feminist leaders in São Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, such as Preta Ferriera, Lélia Gonzalez, and Marielle Franco.

The  formal  categorization  of  individuals  into  sub-categories  by  race  was  constructed  by  the  Spanish  empire  in  the  Americas
through  the  system  of  casta.  Casta  sorted  people  based  on  their  heritage,  religion,  property  ownership,  occupation,  race,  color,
place,  and  legitimacy  of  birth.  A  painting  of  the  casta  designations  can  be  found  in  Figure  4.3  displays  sixteen  different
designations organized hierarchically, with Spanish descendant (Español or Española) individuals ranked at the highest positions
and those with Black and Indigenous ancestry ranked at the bottom. Note that these are historical terms and are not positive identity
labels used in contemporary society. The categories displayed in the painting are included in the following list:

1. Español con India, Mestizo
2. Mestizo con Española, Castizo
3. Castizo con Española, Español
4. Español con Mora, Mulato
5. Mulato con Española, Morisca
6. Morisco con Española, Chino
7. Chino con India, Salta atrás
8. Salta atras con Mulata, Lobo
9. Lobo con China, Gíbaro (Jíbaro)
10. Gíbaro con Mulata, Albarazado
11. Albarazado con Negra, Cambujo
12. Cambujo con India, Sambiaga (Zambiaga)

13. Sambiago con Loba, Calpamulato
14. Calpamulto con Cambuja, Tente en el aire
15. Tente en el aire con Mulata, No te entiendo
16. No te entiendo con India, Torna atrás.

While  the  hierarchies  created  by  Spanish  colonizers  and  other  European  groups  advancing  white  supremacy  and  settler-
colonialism  still  influence  social  standing  today,  there  are  many  active  groups  in  social  movements,  politics,  research,  and
education who are working to cultivate a sense of pride, community, and positive identity among Afro-Latinxs. You can learn more
about these topics in Chapter # 1: Foundations and Contexts. In Mexico, there is one of the largest Afro-Latinx populations. In 2020,
a survey identified over 2.5 million Mexican residents who identify as Afromexican.

## 4.2: Indigenous Histories, Wars, Imperialism, and Migration

Definitions and Theories of Migration and Indigeneity

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical Violence. Please note that this section includes discussions of physical violence.

Indigenous people in Mexico and throughout Latin America impacted by invasions since 1492, imperialist wars, settler economies,
and environmental destruction have had to engage in global migration in order to sustain their families and communities. Theories
of migration and identity formation rooted in sociology, political science, and immigration studies have often tried to separate or
  Chicanx  and
misrepresent  the  realities  of  Indigenous  people,  including  the  presence  and  importance  of  Latinx  Indigeneities.
Latinx  studies  scholars,  especially  Indigenous  scholars,  offer  a  more  holistic  and  clear  understanding  of  the  historical  and
conceptual background for understanding conflict, war, and migration throughout history and today.

To understand the experience of Chicanx and Indigenous Latinx peoples, it is important to understand systems of colonization and
settler  colonialism.  Colonization  refers  to  the  action  of  overtaking  control  of  another  group’s  territory  by  force  using  social,
cultural,  psychological  and  religious  forms  of  domination.  More  specifically,  the  project  of  settler-colonialism refers  to  ongoing
processes where the colonizing groups seek to eradicate and erase the people living in the territory they are colonizing and replace
the Indigenous population with the settler population. For example, while European countries colonized parts of Asia and most of
Africa, settler-colonialism is carried out in places like the Americas, Australia, South Africa, and Israel. One key aspect of settler
colonialism is attempted genocide, which refers to a project trying to eradicate an entire population. This is accompanied by an
ideologically rooted practice of dehumanization to justify and legitimize such actions. Multiple forms of genocide that Indigenous
people have experienced have been identified by the United Nations.

Factors influencing an individual or community’s likelihood to migrate away from their current residence can include things like
the  inability  to  get  a  job,  fear  of  violence,  environmental  degradation,  or  loss  of  family,  as  well  as  the  characteristics  of  the
receiving country, which can include things like the demand for migrant labor and the presence of jobs and housing. In the context
of  Indigenous  migrants’  experiences,  land  displacement,  deterritorialization,  war,  and  colonization  can  separate  families  across
national lines, leading to specific networks and pipelines that facilitate circular migration and enduring transnational ties. As well,
Indigenous peoples construct complex transnational identities, which include critiques of settler and colonizer forces that operate
through nationalism and federal governments.

Displacement can lead to de-Indianization, which refers to the processes of hegemony that disrupt the livelihood of Indigenous
peoples,  through  assaults  on  foodways,  herbal  medical  resources,  and  cultural  sensibilities.
  Systems  of  oppression  by  the
dominant culture impact inter-and-intra-group relations as well this means affect their collaboration and conflict within and across
groups. Also, de-Indianization can manifest in individuals being denied the opportunity to practice Indigenous heritages, languages,
and traditions. This can also manifest in simple ways, like families hiding or ignoring their Indigenous heritage. It also results from
historical, political, and transnational factors. For example, in some cases, major displacements of Indigenous Latinx communities
took place during the 1842 US-Mexican Wars on both sides of the current border, the 1910 Mexican Revolution, the 1970s in Latin
America, and in Central America during the 1980s as part of the US Cold War.

Imperialism, War, and Latinx Migrations

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical Violence. Please note that this section includes discussions of physical violence.

In Mexico, Indigenous peoples have endured and resisted multiple waves of empire and colonization for hundreds of years. Prior to
the  arrival  of  Spanish  colonizers,  much  of  central  and  southern  Mexico,  along  with  central  America,  was  claimed  by  the  Aztec
empire. Notably, the Purépecha people (whose land is located in the state of Michoacan, Mexico) were one of the only groups to
successfully resist and expel Aztec domination. During the period of Spanish colonization, many Indigenous groups worked toward
the goal of liberation and independence, including participating in the Mexican War of Independence, which ended in 1821.

Another form of resistance by Indigenous peoples and mestizos took place with the war against Spain from 1810-1821. The new
Mexican  nation  built  off  of  the  culture  and  standing  of  the  Aztecs  by  including  the  eagle  in  its  flag  and  basing  its  name  on  the
Mexica region and Mexico City, a seat of power for Aztec elites. However, throughout the 1800s, multiple Indigenous groups, such
as the Comanche, Apache, Purépecha, Yaqui, and Maya, continued to engage in resistance against the nationalist project and the

expansive  powers  of  the  federal  Mexican  government.  This  widespread  violence  prompted  many  communities  to  migrate  from
their homelands to new communities and settlements.

In 1845, the United States government annexed Texas, which was considered an act of war by the Mexican government. A year
later, in 1846, the U.S. Congress formally declared war on Mexico, at the request of President Polk. The U.S. was motivated by a
desire to expand its territory westward, under the ideology of “Manifest Destiny,” which is the idea that the United States had a
 Internal politics in the United
divine imperative to colonize the entire continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
States  were  also  focused  on  the  presence  and  expansion  of  slavery,  with  many  of  the  northern  states  and  the  Northwestern
territories outlawing slavery, while southern states defended the institution and sought to expand it into new areas like Texas.

The war between the United States and Mexico lasted two years. The U.S. military attacked and occupied major cities, starting at
the  periphery  of  the  country  and  eventually  moving  forces  deeper  inland  and  capturing  the  capital,  Mexico  City.  The  war
introduced  American  violence  and  colonialism  into  the  lives  of  Mexican  people  and  was  ended  by  the  Treaty  of  Guadalupe-
Hidalgo. In this Treaty, Mexico ceded the land that now comprises the western United States, including all of California, Nevada,
New  Mexico,  and  Utah,  most  of  Arizona  and  Colorado,  and  parts  of  Oklahoma,  Kansas,  and  Wyoming.  Territory  boundaries  in
Mexico prior to the US-Mexico War are displayed in Figure 4.2.1. Prior to the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848,
the  territorial  boundaries  in  the  western  United  States  and  northern  Mexico  were  significantly  different  from  the  present-day
borders. The region was largely under Mexican control and included territories such as Alta California (present-day California),
Nuevo  México  (present-day  New  Mexico),  Tejas  (present-day  Texas),  and  parts  of  Arizona,  Nevada,  Utah,  Colorado,  and
Wyoming.  The  border  between  Mexico  and  the  United  States  was  not  clearly  defined,  and  there  were  ongoing  disputes  and
conflicts over the control of these territories.

At the end of the 19th century, the United States furthered its imperialist military aggression during the Spanish-American War,
which occurred during the spring and summer of 1898. The Spanish government’s hold on its colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific
Ocean was weakened by internal politics and growing resistance among the peoples living under colonial rule. The war began in
Cuba,  with  the  U.S.  supporting  the  Cuban  dissidents  who  were  asserting  their  independence  from  Spain.  The  United  States
mobilized its Navy against the Spanish, however, this did not lead to independence for Cubans. Instead, Cuba was taken under U.S.
control for a period of time.

The war between the U.S. and Spain also included Puerto Rico, which was converted from the Spanish colonizers to become a U.S.
territory. And the war extended to the Pacific Ocean, with the U.S. taking over colonial control of the Philippines and capturing the
territory  of  Guam.  In  all  of  these  locations,  including  the  Caribbean,  the  Spanish-American  War  created  a  new  relationship  of
migration between the mainland U.S. and the peoples living in the Caribbean islands. By the 20th century, tens of thousands of
Cuban and Puerto Rican migrants had made their homes in the mainland United States.

At the same time, the social and cultural upheaval in Mexico led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910. This revolution elevated the
political  ideology  Indigenismo  which  emphasizes  celebrating  Indigenous  cultures  and  the  Indigenous  peoples  are  often  the
foundation  of  contemporary  Mexican  culture,  politics,  and  society.  Indigenous  Leaders  like  Emiliano  Zapata  led  the  1910

revolution  calling  for  land  reform  (i.e.,  El  Plan  de  Ayala)  to  redistribute  land  to  the  working  class  and  break  up  the  control  and
domination  by  the  landowning  elite  (hacienderos).  Zapata’s  Indigenous  tribal  community  in  Puebla  was  deeply  tied  to  land  and
communal corn traditions. He actually carried the land grants of his tribe. This personal experience informed his commitment to
fight for a degree of sovereignty.

Beyond  economic  concerns,  the  ideology  of  Indigenismo  was  also  championed  and  represented  by  cultural  figures  like  Diego
Rivera and Frida Kahlo. The recognition of cultural value led the post-revolutionary Mexican government, like Lazaro Cardenas’
administration  to  support  bilingual  education  in  Spanish  and  Indigenous  languages.  Cardenas’  commitment  to  Indigenous  tribal
communities throughout Mexico, led to some threats on his life. At one point the Indigenous people of Janitzio, Michocan, had to
hide and protect his life for a period. Anti-Indian and racist sentiments of the cientificos (eugenics) of the 1940s attacked policy and
efforts benefiting Indigenous people of Mexico.  In many ways, Indigenous groups have cultivated energy and support to carry on
their heritage by teaching traditional customs and practices in the face of threat and violence.

In  addition  to  the  conditions  in  the  “homeland”  in  the  20th  century,  the  dynamics  of  U.S.  Imperialism  and  militarism  also
negatively impacted the lives and migration patterns of Indigenous peoples in Latin America. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s, the United States government directly and indirectly caused widespread political instability and supported the overthrow of
standing governments throughout South and Central America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay.

These actions were sponsored as part of the Cold War and politicians justified them by highlighting the antagonism between the
U.S.  and  Communist  countries,  especially  the  Soviet  Union  and  China.  In  the  process,  many  Indigenous  communities  living  in
Latin America were subjected to violence, political corruption, and economic devastation. This led some Indigenous and mestizo
groups to migrate to the United States, including entire communities and networks who brought with them Indigenous traditions of
health and healing, languages, and customs of cultural wealth that they nurtured and passed on in their new homes. As a result,
many  communities  in  cities  such  as  Los  Angeles,  Oxnard,  Fresno,  Bakersfield,  and  Santa  Maria  in  California  have  substantial
populations of Indigenous migrants from Mexico and Central America. They have created organizations of support as well, such as
the Frente and others.

## 4.3: Narratives, Representation, Epistemic Violence, and Healing

Dominant Narratives in the Representation of Native American and Indigenous Histories

When  was  the  last  time  someone  told  you  that  you  are  important,  your  Indigenous  ancestors  matter,  and  that  you  can  make  a
difference in your community? Worldwide Indigenous peoples have emphasized the value of community survivance. The reality of
Indigenous peoples living and thriving in the contemporary global society while affirming their dignity and resisting neocolonial
systems of oppression continues. In this section, you will learn more specifically about contested  narratives of  Native Americans
and Indigenous Peoples. For example, this includes a recognition of the solidarity between Chicanx and Indigenous struggles such
as in the 1992 protest of the 1994 Columbus Celebration in the U.S., the struggle against the PeaBody Coal Mining Industry in
reservations, and more recently Standing Rock against the DAPL.

The  saying  “Indians  are  dead”  is  part  of  a  master narrative  that  continues  to  circulate  in  schools  and  society.  We  refute  that
Indigenous people are dead or have disappeared. In the western hemisphere, Central America and the southern part of Mexico are
home to the largest number of living Indigenous people today. In addition, people  who self-identify as Chicana/o/x, Latina/o/x,
Puerto Rican, Central American, and South American often have ancestors with Indigenous roots and they carry on their cultures,
languages,  traditions,  and  lifeways.  Roberto  “Cintli”  Rodriguez  and  others  have  referred  to  members  of  this  group  as  la  Raza,
which means people whose genetic matter has been in this hemisphere for thousands of years.

For  many  years,  American  and  European  scholars  have  presented  the  Bering  Strait  Theory  to    describe  and  categorize  Native
Americans  as  migrants  to  this  country.  This  follows  the  logic  of  an  “Out  of  Africa”  hypothesis  of  human  evolution,  which
postulates that modern human beings emerged from a single pair of genetic ancestors living in Africa, in an approximate location
that would match the Bible’s description of the Garden of Eden. This theory suggests that humans arrived in the Americas about
15,000 years ago by migrating from Asia over through the Bering Strait, a land bridge between what is today called Russia and
Alaska. This area was passable by land at the time, although it is covered in the ocean today. Native Americans and Indigenous
people do not describe themselves as migrants from another place but have scientific and cultural knowledge of originating in their
homelands. As Indigenous scholar and activist Vine Deloria has argued, along with other scholars and critics, there are increasing
amounts  of  archeological  and  scientific  evidence  that  refute  the  Bering  Strait  Theory,  suggesting  that  the  Bering  Strait  was
unpassable until about 12,600 years ago, which is after documented human life had spread throughout North and South America.

The connection to the homeland is represented in creation stories. Each tribal community represents their ethics of stewardship and
tending the land and culture in their stories. This is true and important for Indigenous people across the hemisphere, as noted in the
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. This historic document sets the precedent for international law and
the need to recognize the collective rights and sovereignty of Indigenous peoples on their land. It is available online on the United
Nations  website.  In  specific  tribal  community  contexts,  creation  stories  refer  to  the  ecology  and  often  center  on  a  significant
relative in the region, such as ants, badgers, birds, condors, corn, eagles, ravens, serpents, turtles, whales, and specific mountains.
Stories  of  Indigenous  heritage  are  shared  through  oral  history.  These  stories  carry  important  values,  beliefs,  sensibilities,  and
dispositions on ecology, life, death, and regeneration. These stories reflect the diversity within Indigenous peoples, their land, and
cultural pride.

 Cultural Spotlight: Cahuilla Bird Songs

Bird  Songs  are  a  part  of  the  California  Native  American  traditions  including  the  Cahuilla  people  located  in  southern
California,.  The  practice  of  Bird  Songs  in  celebrations,  community  gatherings,  and  ceremonies  helps  to  communicate  a
continued cultural tradition that is rooted in ancestral knowledge. The documentary, “We Are Birds: A California Indian Story”
by  Albert  Chacon,  which  is  available  on  YouTube  and  licensed  CC  BY  3.0,  demonstrates  these  practice  real-time.  The  full
documentary is one hour, seven minutes, and ten seconds.

 Activity: Indigenous Land Website

Stories of Indigenous heritage are shaped by the specificity of each group’s creation story or creation story reflecting traditions
and responsibilities tied to their people’s land, ecology, and/or sacred spaces. You can learn more about the Indigenous peoples
of various lands throughout the world by visiting the Native Land map website. This is a secondary collection of territories and
Indigenous  peoples,  which  includes  links  to  primary  sources  and  information  on  Indigenous  tribal  lands.  You  can  search  by
address, and one interesting place to start can be by exploring where you are currently residing or studying.

Struggles for Truth and Accountability in Cultural Narratives

Queer Chicana author Gloria Anzaldúa based her work  on the knowledge of  Native American studies scholars like Jack Forbes to
represent the Indigenous realities of mestiza/o/x peoples. Her book Borderlands/La Frontera was first published in Spanglish and
represents the sensibilities of mestizas, including topics like Indigeneity, Nepantla, Two-Spirit duality, and fluidity of gender, and
colonial gendered morality. These areas of inquiry are carried on by young people and elders who work together to carry on their
Indigenous traditions. Among the Indigenous cultural work  Elder and Capitana of Danza Mexica Azteca Angelbertha Cobb, who
is pictured in Figure 4.3.1. She posed in front of an artistic rendition of La Malinche, mother of the first mestizo, her same gesture
and  position.  In  Mexico  City,  Cobb  was  close  friends  with  Frida  Khalo  and  Diego  Rivera  and  also  directly  benefited  from  the
efforts of President Lazaro Cardenas, who recruited her as one of the best Indigenous dancers in the highland of Puebla. Cultural
workers like her, and the work of other Indigenous cultural groups have helped to sustain and communicate traditional knowledge
through art, dance, and dress.

Solidarity across Indigenous and non-Indigenous people have been key to the survivance of Native peoples.
 Survivance refers to
the collective process of survival, which carries forward the culture, peoples, and land beyond the individual. For example, since
the early 1970s, a segment of Chicanxs, aware of and attached to their Indigenous roots, have participated in and supported the
United Nations Committee for Advancing Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Cultures Worldwide. Chicanxs and Latinxs people who
support  solidarity  with  Indigenous  peoples  have  supported  self-determination,  cultures,  and  political  resilience.  Through  the
emergence  of  ethnic  studies,  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies,  Native  American  studies,  and  the  American  Indian  Movement  (AIM),
there  has  been  an  increase  in  awareness  of  various  Indigenous  movements.  These  movements  share  a  commitment  to
Indigenization,  supporting  revitalization  of  Native  languages,  ancestral  foodways,  medical  use,  cultural  burnings,  midwifery
traditions, dances, coming-of-age ceremonies, land acknowledgment, and more.

In  order  to  effectively  support  decolonization,  it  is  necessary  to  cultivate  knowledge  of  diverse  tribal  groups.  Awareness  and
education in the US of Indigenous and Native peoples, both past and present, can be attributed to the legacy and efforts of the civil
rights  movement,  the  American  Indian  Movement,  Native  American  studies,  and  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies,  as  well  as  global
Indigenous movements. Some examples include Sandinistas, Zapatistas, and water protection.
 In the context of the 1960s civil
rights movement, there was a call to end institutional racism and colonization, to go beyond Eurocentric curriculum/knowledge,
and  for  self-determination.  With  this  came  the  emergence  of  ethnic  studies  and  Native  American  studies  at  colleges  and
universities,  which  studied  and  deconstructed  the  colonial  master  narrative  and  connotation  of  triumphalist  narratives  of  white
supremacy and settler-colonialism, including holidays like Columbus Day.

For 500 years, the master narrative surrounding Columbus stood in the United States. Columbus Day became a federal holiday in
the  1930s,  however,  several  communities  across  the  U.S.  have  come  to  realize  and  recognize  the  truth  surrounding  the  violent
domination and oppression that led to the slavery and genocide against Indigenous people in the Americas. Interestingly Indigenous
Peoples Day, known as “Dia de La Raza” in Latin America and Mexico, has been recognized since World War I. In the United
States, in many states and cities, Columbus Day has been replaced with Indigenous People’s Day, after many protests and efforts of

advocacy.  For  a  deeper  exploration  of  this  developing  history,  the  next  section  goes  into  more  depth  on  the  timeline  of  these
movements.

A Timeline of Solidarity between Chicanxs and North American Native Americans

Given  the  lack  of  California  homeland  education,  in  1969  the  California  Indian  Education  Association  established  the  Annual
California  Indian  Conference  to  begin  focusing  on  curriculum  and  educational  issues  impacting  California  Indian  students  and
tribal communities.

In 1973, the American Indian Movement members and their allies met and decided to form the International Indian Treaty
Council (IITC) to seek justice in the United Nations. In July 1990, Indigenous Chicanxs and Latinxs participated in the
Indigenous Encuentro in Quito, Ecuador, where they had a seat at the table.
In 1992 the IITC, which included Indigenous Chicanxs, stood strongly against the United States celebrating the 1492 invasion
of Columbus. Indigenous people from across the Americas stood strongly in opposition, vowingnot tot celebrate the genocide of
their ancestors through the proposed Columbus Day Celebration. The IITC and others raised awareness about the implications
of genocide and the Doctrine of Discovery of Indigenous people. Political artists like Aztlan Underground and various Mexica
Aztec Danza groups supported this movement as well.
In 1994 the Zapatista uprising and social movement that Chicanx supported began in response to the oppression and domination
by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA altered the Mexican Constitution so that ejido plots of land could
be sold to foreigners, where in the past it had been illegal.
In 1995, some Chicanxs learned first-hand about resistance to environmental destruction by mining companies from the Diné
Navajo Grandmothers. Chicanxs were invited to be a group of protectors for the Grandmothers from a coal mining company
attempting to occupy their land. On the reservation, they learned about the historical resistance to genocide, toxic pollution in
water, and nuclear waste to the environment.
In 1998 California Native American Day was established and continues today to teach people of all ages about the tribal
culture, histories, and heritage of California Native American tribes. In the same year, the State Board of Education adopted
academic content standards for history-social studies but did not recognize the genocide of Native Americans. Then again in
2000, the California Department of Education did not recognize the genocide of Indigenous people in the model curriculum for
human rights and genocide.
In 2007 Josefina Medina and Rufina Juarez participated at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues
with La Red Xicana Indigena,  an  Indigenous  women’s  network,  to present a Special Rapporteur on Migration Issues and
food sovereignty.
By 2007 the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), supported by the IITC, was completed
and signed by all member countries in the United Nations. The U.S. was the last to sign. UNDRIP recognizes the history and
contemporary experience of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Article 14 recognized the right to education without
discrimination and access to cultural knowledge.
In 2012, the Idle No More movement was born out of resistance to policy surrounding land and water impacting First Peoples
in Canada. Native Americans, Indigenous peoples of the Americas, and allies including Chicanxs supported this movement
across contemporary settler borders. The conversation about genocide, land invasion and the importance of Indigenous cultural
pride was highlighted throughout this movement, and continued into the United States
In community gathering spaces formed within protest sites, from 2016 to 2017, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, water protectors
from several Native American tribes, and Indigenous Peoples from across the hemisphere -- including South and Central
America and Mexico -- came together to resist the Dakota Access Pipeline. They provided lessons about resistance to
environmental destruction, intergenerational trauma, and survivance. These understandings were shared with thousands of
families, allies, and media reporters for an entire year and beyond.
In terms of cultural sovereignty and cultural revitalization, in the context of Indigenous Latinxs in California, we have observed
a move toward bilingual and trilingual education, including English, Spanish, Mixteco, and other Indigenous languages. In
2017, First Nations launched the Native Language Immersion Initiative to support new generations of Native speakers and
positive role models for young people. Some of these efforts are documented by the Oaxacalifornia Reporting Team.
In 2017, Maylei Blackwell, Floridalma Boj Lopez, and Luis Urrieta Jr. published a special issue on “Critical Latinx
Indigeneities” in the academic journal, Latino Studies. This helped to establish the importance of considering the dynamics of
Indigeneity more closely among Indigenous Latinx populations.
In 2019, the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee convened at the California Department of
Education in Sacramento and began with a land acknowledgment. The first draft of the high school curriculum was the first

ever to recognize the genocide and survivance of California Indians and Indigenous people. Chicanx that served on the
committee, originally included a lesson about land acknowledgment and protection of sacred sites, but they were phased out.
By 2022 the Indigenous Mayan-inspired poem, In Lak’Ech, was removed from State Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Currently, the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is creating more Native American Studies lessons on topics such as
environment, citizenship, and culture, compared to the State Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for various grade levels.

## 4.4: Gender, Sexuality, Migration, and Indigeneity

Gender, Migration, and Indigeneity

(cid:0)   Content  Warning:  Physical  and  Sexual  Violence.  Please  note  that  this  section  includes  discussions  of  physical  and  sexual
violence.

Critical  Latinx  Indigeneity  emphasizes  the  complicated  relationship  between  Indigenous  peoples,  historical  traditions,  and
contemporary  structures  of  governments  across  borders.  For  instance,  Indigenous  migrants  can  benefit  from  and  participate  in

critical  perspectives  with  cultural  humility  between  various  contexts  can  allow  Indigenous  communities  to  forge  more  effective
solidarities  and  resist  settler-colonial  structures.  Utilizing  an  intersectional  perspective  also  helps  to  balance  the  complexity  of
Indigeneity with migration status, alongside gender, sexuality, and economic factors.

Gender  and  family  dynamics  are  deeply  influential  in  shaping  both  immigration  policies  and  immigrant  experiences.  Labor
demands  are  often  constructed  in  binary  gendered  terms.  For  instance,  the  Bracero  program  from  1942  to  1964  solicited
agricultural labor from Mexican nationals in the U.S., focusing on short-term visas offered to individual mestizo men. This was
meant  to  restrict  the  formation  of  family  and  sustained  communities  and  instead  contribute  to  the  exploitation  of

farmworkers.
This  created  a  ready  supply  of  unemployed  migrants  who  were  ineligible  for  virtually  any  other  kind  of  legal  employment.  By
contrast, domestic work and care industries often rely on migrant women laborers. However, a similar logic of family separation
and isolation contributes to exploitation and poor working conditions. In particular, for workers who provide service directly in the
home, such as nannies, housekeepers, cooks, and nurses, employers can leverage a workers’ documentation status to exploit their
time,  provide  substandard  pay,  and  carry  out  sustained  emotional  manipulation.
  These  positions  are  more  often  occupied  by
Indigenous peoples, given that they are more likely to be low-income and/or undocumented.

Gender influences the multi-level factors that determine community wellbeing, including the disparate impact of gender norms on
sexual health and private relationships  and the global dynamics of climate change and environmental crises caused by capitalist
structures.
 In the context of sustained political assaults on Indigenous Latinx family structures, sustaining kinship structures takes

position in the community that encompassed both sexuality and gender, such as individuals born male who take on women’s social
roles. In virtually all societies, they were understood as an included part of the community, often revered or eligible for advanced
social  standing.  For  example,  Chumash  tribes  recognized  “aqi”  (Ventureño  Chumash  word  for  “third-gender  people”)
  for
thousands of years prior to the arrival of Europeans. The Chumash peoples are the stewards and Indigenous peoples of land that
was  previously  Mexico  and  recolonized  the  United  States.  The  previous  Spanish,  and  sometimes  Spanish  Mexican,  colonizers
systemically assaulted the homes, lives, and lifeways of Native peoples. They made a particular target of the aqi. In Spanish, they
renamed the third-gender people “joya” (or “olla”) which means jewel, because of their prized status to the Native communities,
and  also  vessel,  eliciting  a  derogatory  association  and  justifying  practices  of  inhumane  torture  and  murder.  Chumash  scholar
Deborah Miranda named this system gendercide and it is a common tactic in settler-colonialism.

Third-gender people play an important role in Chicanx, Indigenous Latinx, and Latinx communities throughout the United States
and  Latina  America.  Many  Native  communities  have  continued  to  operate  their  traditional  customs,  languages,  and  ways  of
knowing under the radar of colonizers.
 The Zapotec people, who are Indigenous to lands in southern Mexico, presently known as
the  state  of  Oaxaca,  recognize  a  third  gender,  Muxes.  They  are  an  important  part  of  the  community’s  traditions  and  culture.
Festivals and celebrations honoring Muxes have also contributed to a transnational identity for Zapotecs. Festivals honoring Muxes
are held in Oaxaca and in large migrant communities in the United States, like Los Angeles. As well, La Asociación Nacional de
Comercio y Turismo LGBT (Mexican LGBT National Association of Commerce and Tourism)  created Ruta Istmo (Istmo Route),
the  first  touristic  route  in  Oaxaca  to  highlight  the  Muxe  identity.  These  efforts  work  to  support  the  contemporary  Zapoteca
community and their ways of life. One Muxe performer, Lukas Avendaño, is displayed in Figure 4.4.1, in a long, short-sleeve black

and white dress, embroidered with red, purple, and yellow flowers. This is an example of the centrality of traditional culture and
fashion to the practices of Muxes.

Two-Spirit Identities and Pan-Indigenous Solidarity

Given that both Indigenous spirituality and non-gender binary ways were stolen upon European invasion, Indigenous people from
various tribes have come together to reconnect and build connections between these communities and experiences. This process
contributed to the development of the term Two-Spirit in 1990 by Native people to talk about sexual and gender identities across
tribal contexts. It was developed in part as a response to the widespread use of the term “berdache,” an adapted French word that
was popularized by settler anthropologists and carries a dehumanizing stigma to imply a male prostitute (derived from the Arabic,
“Bardaj,”  meaning  “captive”  or  “slave”).  Two-Spirit  is  not  a  translation  of  any  specific  tribal  term,  but  rather  a  way  to
communicate  within  an  English-speaking  context  about  the  common  commitment  to  decolonization  and  liberation  for  all
Indigenous people.

The term Two-Spirit should be understood as complementary to LGBTQ, within the context of Indigenous communities. It does
not replace tribally-specific identity labels, nor does it replace sexual orientation and gender identities exactly. For example, Two-
Spirit  people  may  have  one  or  more  tribal  affiliations  and  may  also  identify  as  one  or  more  LGBTQ  identities.  LGBTQ  Native
Americans were looking for a way to remove themselves from a culture that emphasizes sexuality over spirituality and a way to
reconnect  with  their  own  tribal  communities.  Adopting  the  Two-Spirit  term  was  the  answer.  The  term  is  sometimes  referenced
more abstractly to indicate two contrasting spirits, such as “Warrior and Clan Mother” or “Eagle and Coyote.” Cherokee scholar,
Qwo-Li Driskill describes his relationship between Two-Spiritedness, Queer and Trans Identity in his own tribal context:

I  find  myself  using  both  the  words  “Queer”  and  “Trans”  to  try  to  translate  my  gendered  and  sexual  realities  for  those  not
familiar with Native traditions, but at heart, if there is a term that could possibly describe me in English, I simply consider
myself  a  Two-Spirit  person.  The  process  of  translating  Two-Spiritness  with  terms  in  white  communities  becomes  very
complex. I’m not necessarily “Queer” in Cherokee contexts, because differences are not seen in the same light as they are in
Euroamerican contexts. I’m not necessarily “Transgender” in Cherokee contexts, because I’m simply the gender I am. I’m
not necessarily “Gay,” because that word rests on the concept of men-loving-men, and ignores the complexity of my gender
identity. It is only within the rigid gender regimes of white America that I become Trans or Queer.

The embedded Video 4.4.1 discusses in further depth the complexity of perspective among queer Natives with respect to culture,
tradition,  and  holidays  like  Thanksgiving.  To  watch  the  video  in  full  is  17  minutes  and  42  seconds.  The  video  presents  an
interpretation and perspective from one voice, which reflects the range of factors that influence decision-making about everyday
activities  for  Native  and  Indigenous  peoples.  As  you  watch  the  video,  please  note  the  ways  that  Indigeneity  impacts  modern
experiences.

Queer and Trans Migration Experiences

(cid:0)   Content  Warning:  Physical  and  Sexual  Violence.  Please  note  that  this  section  includes  discussions  of  physical  and  sexual
violence.

Gender  and  sexuality  also  profoundly  shape  the  experiences  of  Indigenous  Latinx  and  mestizo  queer  and  trans  migrants  in  the
context  of  larger  systems  and  structures.
  For  instance,  Manuel  Guzmán  defined  “sexiles”  as  “those  queer  migrants  leaving
home/nation  as  a  result  of  their  sexuality.”   For  example,  individuals  may  be  experiencing  repressive  conditions,  external
violence, or family rejection due to sexual stigma and seek new opportunities with communities. Individuals may also immigrate to
seek medical treatment, such as for HIV, or gender-affirming therapies and surgical procedures. Queer and trans communities are
characterized by differential access for immigrants and citizens to cultural fields, political inclusion, and collective membership.

Queer  and  trans  immigrants  asylum  seekers  and  refugees  face  persistent  exclusion  and  barriers  to  migration.  Gays  and  lesbians
have been explicitly barred from immigrating to the U.S. including the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which disallowed
“sexual deviants,” and remained in effect until 1990. Even after the outright ban was lifted, structural heterosexism continued to
block queer and trans people. The ban on HIV-positive immigrants was in effect until 2010 and disparately affects queer and trans
people. Similarly, until the federal Defense of Marriage Act was repealed in 2013, same-sex married couples were not recognized
as families for immigration procedures. Today, LGBTQ people still face disparate barriers to adequate representation and may not
have legal standing in their home countries to recognize important kinship ties.

Further,  the  violent  and  militarized  system  of  U.S.  immigration  traumatizes  and  abuses  asylum  seekers,  especially  transgender
migrants.   Christina  Madrazo  sued  the  U.S.  government  for  $15  million,  due  to  being  held  in  detention  and  allegedly  raped  by
Lemar Smith twice in May of 2000.  Because of a plea deal, his charges were reduced from felonies to misdemeanors, lowering his
sentence from 42 years to 8 months.
 Chicanx and Latinx communities experience distinct forms of oppression, prompting some
scholars  and  activists  to  further  adapt  terminology  to  reflect  these  differences.  For  example,  the  term  cuir  (queer)  “registers  the
geopolitical inflection towards the south and from the peripheries, in counterpoint to colonial epistemology and Anglo-American
historiography.”

Queer refers [..] to those who are able to evade interpretative unidirectionality, who are able to be unintelligible at first sight,
those people outside of the simple models and frames of hegemonic representation, which is not very difficult to achieve in a
g-local world that is presumed to be ‘white’ even though the majority of its inhabitants are not ‘white’.

You  can  review  more  about  the  complexity  of  queer  and  trans  identities  among  Chicanx  and  Indigenous  Latinx  communities  in
Section ## 6.4: Jotería Frameworks and Scholarly Conversations. In Figure 4.4.2, a photo of London Pride is displayed with a group
of  activists  holding  a  sign  that  says  “Lesbian  and  Gay  Immigration  Group.  Supporting  LGBTI  Asylum  Seekers  and  Refugees,”
along with various national and pride flags in hand. These types of intersectional organizations address the unique needs related to
migration, gender, and sexuality.

## 4.5: Conclusion

Summary

In  this  chapter,  we  applied  theories  and  knowledge  produced  by  Chicanx  and  Indigenous  Latinx  communities  to  describe  the
critical  events,  histories,  intellectual  traditions,  contributions,  lived  experiences  and  social  struggles  of  groups  with  a  particular
emphasis  on  agency  and  group  affirmation.  We  learned  more  deeply  about  how  settler  colonialism,  mestizaje  (or  mixed-race
identity), and the complex dynamics of Indigeneity and migration affect politics, social movements, and cultural productions.

We explained and assessed how struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation, as experienced, enacted, and
studied by Chicanx and Indigenous Latinx people of the Americas, are relevant to current and structural issues such as communal,
national,  international,  and  transnational  politics  as,  for  example,  in  immigration,  settler-colonialism,  multiculturalism,  and
language policies. Indigenous peoples have been leaders in various movements for social change, equity, justice, and inclusion that
benefit all sectors of society.

Also, in this chapter, we described and learned skills to actively engage with anti-racist and anti-colonial issues and the practices
and  movements  in  Chicanx  and  Indigenous  Latinx  communities  to  build  a  just  and  equitable  society.  This  includes  a  clear
awareness of the intersecting dynamics of race, gender, and sexuality that impact both migrants and Indigenous peoples in distinct
ways.

Key Terms

Genocide: As defined by the United Nations, “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a
national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

1. Killing members of the group;
2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in

part;

4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

Native American: A member of any of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, often used to refer to those from the continental
United  States,  Alaska,  and  Canada.  Native  Americans  are  the  original  inhabitants  of  these  regions  and  have  diverse  cultures,
languages, and traditions that vary among different tribes and nations. They have a unique historical and cultural connection to the
land and have faced a history of colonization, displacement, and ongoing struggles for recognition, rights, and self-determination.

Decolonization:  The  multiple  processes  of  resistance  that  work  to  end  the  dynamics  of  colonialism  and  establish,  restore,  and
defend Indigenous sovereignty. It is important to note that decolonization is a political process that refers specifically to Indigenous
sovereignty, and it is not a general term that captures all forms of social justice.

Anahuac: The Nahua word for Mesoamerica. Also called Abya Yala.

Indigeneity:  A  broad  term  used  to  refer  to  a  sense  of  belonging  and  ties  prior  to  colonization  among  people  from  a  shared
homeland. It is important to understand the distinctions between Chicanx, Indigenous Latinx, and Latinx Indigenites.

Indigenous Chicanx: A  term  that  signifies  being  Indigenous  to  Anahuac  (Mesoamerica),  It  is  a  self-identity  category  used  by
people, unlike Hispanic or Latinx which emerged from western institutions.

Xicanx:  A  preferred  identity  term  for  Chicanx  involved  in  Indigenous  movements  there  is  often  a  preference  to  use  the  term
Xicanx and not Chicanx. The Chi is the same sound as Xi, but Chi is the Spanish pronunciation and the Xi is the Indigenous one.

Indigenous Latinx: An umbrella term used to refer to Indigenous migrants to the United States from South and Central America,
the Caribbean, and Mexico (for example, Maya, Mixteco, Purépecha, Taino, Zapoteco, etc.).

Critical Latinx Indigeneity: A term defined by Maylei Blackwell and colleagues as a lens to “critique enduring colonial logics
and practices that operate from different localities of power as well as the physical, social, cultural, economic, and psychological

violence  that  often  targets  Indigenous  Latinx  peoples,  including  forms  of  state  and  police  violence,  cultural  appropriation,
economic exploitation, gender violence, social exclusion, and psychological abuse.”

Indigenismo:  A  term  that  emphasizes  a  celebration  of  Indigenous  cultures  and  that  Indigenous  peoples  are  the  foundation  of
contemporary Mexican culture, politics, and society. This is often deployed as an Aztec-centric celebration of the Indigenous past
of the nation, which often serves to erase the present and future of the sixty-three Indigenous pueblos of Mexico and the millions of
Indigenous peoples living around the world.

Indigenous: A label used to describe peoples who existed before colonization, and can be used to describe the Indigenous peoples
of the Americas. Always use the capital I: “Indigenous” to designate the term as a proper noun.

Mestizas/os/xs: A diverse population that has a combination of mixed heritage, often including Indigenous lineage, along with a
combination of African and/or European backgrounds.

Mestizaje (mixed-race identity): A term that emphasizes the multiple lineages that not only shape individual identity, but also the
communities, cultures, languages, and traditions that we practice.

Post-racial society: The  idea  that  all  ethnic  differences  have  fused,  and  it  erases  the  realities  of  inequity  and  the  importance  of
advocates  calling  for  justice.  For  Indigenous  peoples,  reductive  deployments  of  ethnic  categorization  can  disrupt  attempts  for
collective liberation.

Afro-Latinx: A term that describes people from Latin America of African descent.

Settler-colonialism: Instances of colonization where the colonizing groups seek to eradicate the people living in the territory they
are colonizing and replace the Indigenous population with the settler population.

Colonization: The action of overtaking control of another group’s territory by force.

Attempted genocide: A project of trying to eradicate an entire population. This is accompanied by an ideologically rooted practice
of dehumanization to justify and legitimize such actions.

De-Indianization: The processes that disrupt the livelihood of Indigenous peoples, through assaults on foodways, herbal medical
resources, and cultural sensibilities.

Master narratives: Culturally sanctioned stories that benefit the status quo and members of privileged groups.

Sovereignty: Not a metaphor but rather the capacity and ability to exercise collective self-determination to govern one's people and
land. North American Indians are the only group in the United States whose sovereignty is recognized in the Constitution of the
United  States.  In  the  context  of  Indigenous  people,  sovereignty  has  often  been  undermined  and  determined  by  settler-colonial
constructs.

Survivance: A term coined by Anishinaabe scholar and writer, Gerald Vizenor, refers to the collective process of survival, which
carries forward the culture, peoples, and land beyond the individual.

Indigenization:  Efforts  supporting  revitalization  of  Native  languages,  ancestral  foodways,  medical  use,  cultural  burnings,
midwifery traditions, dances, coming-of-age ceremonies, land acknowledgment, and more

Gendercide: The systematic violence that targets non-binary individuals in the pursuit of settler-colonial goals. Chumash scholar
Deborah Miranda coined this term in the context of Spanish assaults on the aqi.

Two-Spirit: A term that was developed by Indigenous peoples to describe the shared experience of third gender people. Two-Spirit
should only be used in reference to Indigenous peoples, and whenever possible, in conjunction with a more tribally specific term.

Sexiles: Queer migrants leaving their home/nation as a result of their sexuality.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 5: Feminisms

 Learning Objectives

Outline the origins and history of Chicana/Latina feminist thought and activism.
Explain the relationship between Chicana/Latina feminisms and U.S. Third World feminism.
Summarize and evaluate Chicana/Latina feminist issues and movements.
Outline the features of Chicana/Latina studies, including the field’s origins and attributes.

Introduction

What or who do you imagine when you hear the word “feminism?” You might be surprised to learn that there are numerous strands
of feminism even among racialized groups, which is why we use the plural “feminisms.” In particular, Chicana/Latina feminisms
constitute  a  multifaceted  artistic,  intellectual,  and  political  project  and  movement  invested  in  personal  transformation  and  social
change. First and foremost, Chicana/Latina feminists are committed to confronting and disrupting patriarchy as it intersects with
multiple systems of oppression such as white supremacy, neoliberal capitalism, and imperialism- illustrated in Figure 5.1.

 Key Term: Patriarchy

Patriarchy  is  a  system  of  gender-based  control  and  domination  where  women  and  gender  non-conforming  people  are
subordinated to men through legal and extralegal measures. Patriarchy “includes cultural ideas about men and women, the web
of relationships that structure social life, and the unequal distribution of power, rewards, and resources that underlies privilege
and oppression.”

These systems structure our everyday lives––from our intimate interpersonal relationships, the economic and educational resources
we  have  access  to,  and  even  the  ways  knowledge  is  constructed.  Chicana  feminist  and  professor  María  Eugenia  Cotera  defines
Latina feminism this way:

Latina  feminism  offers  an  intersectional  approach  to  understanding  and  combating  the  relations  of  domination  and
subordination that structurally disenfranchise Latina/o communities, broadly conceived. Like the Latinas who developed its
primary conceptualizations, theories, and practices, Latina feminism has been shaped as much by experiences of colonization
and U.S. imperialism and of diaspora and border-crossing, as it has been by day-to-day lived experiences of heterosexism,
racism, and classism in the United States. Indeed, contemporary Latina feminists—from academics to community organizers
—have  charted  a  genealogy  of  praxis  that  reaches  beyond  national  borders  and  deep  into  history,  recuperating  a  set  of
feminist practices that articulate the complex intersections of identity and subjectivity.

As  you  will  learn,  there  are  multiple  ideologies,  expressions,  tactics,  and  modes  of  Chicana/Latina  feminism  that  have  been
deployed  since  the  late  1960s.  These  modes  are  regularly  evaluated  and  debated  wherever  Chicana/Latina  feminist  discourse  is
taken  up––in  homes,  grassroots  community  organizations,  cultural  production,  and  academia.  In  other  words,  Chicana/Latina
feminisms are not static. They are constantly evolving, providing us with new knowledge, theories, and insights to this day. This
chapter provides a primer on Chicana/Latina feminisms, introducing readers to the origins, early issues, ongoing movements, and
activist causes, the founding of Chicana/Latina studies as an academic discipline, fundamental theories and major debates within
the discipline, and tools and strategies Chicana/Latina feminisms offer those of us interested liberation and freedom.

## 5.1: The Roots and Routes of Chicana/Latina Feminisms

A Rising Ethnic Feminist Consciousness

The emergence of what we now understand as Chicana/Latina feminisms can be traced back to ethnic nationalist movements of the
late  1960s  and  early  1970s.  As  Chicana/o/xs  and  Puerto  Ricans  challenged  racism  and  economic  oppression  across  the  U.S.,
women  faced  an  additional  battle––sexism,  that  is,  discrimination  or  devaluation  based  on  their  sex  or  gender.  Through  their
activism,  writing,  and  visual  and  performance  art,  Chicana/Latina  feminists  brought  to  light  the  ways  that  patriarchy  unevenly
structured gender roles in their intimate relationships, within their organizations, movements, and in U.S. institutions. As noted in
Chapter # 7: Social Movement Activity, various struggles with different leaders, agendas, organizational philosophies, strategies, and
tactics, often regional in scope, collectively defined El Movimiento. Chicanas and Latinas were active within each movement and
in  every  locale  since  the  beginning,  and  they  developed  as  cultural  nationalists  alongside  their  male  counterparts  who  espoused
ethnic  pride  and  self-determination.  As  the  women  developed  an  ethnic  and  class  consciousness,  they  also  began  to  develop  a
feminist  consciousness  critical  of  machismo,  as  it  was  often  referred  to  in  their  early  writings.  Despite  their  critiques,  most
feminists did not want to create a separate movement. Instead, they hoped that their perspectives and advocacy would transform
and  strengthen  movement  ideologies  and  agendas.  In  other  words,  “Chicana  feminist  thought  reflected  a  historical  struggle  by
women  to  overcome  sexist  oppression  but  still  affirm  a  militant  ethnic  consciousness.”   Figure  5.1.1  depicts  a  brown-skinned
Xicana who has ethnic pride and a feminist consciousness, as suggested by the title, “Viva La Mujer.” The hot pink background
suggests inner strength, love, and rebelliousness.

Chicana  feminists  organized  regional  and  national  conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  caucuses,  and  consciousness-raising  (CR)
group meetings in the early 1970s that provided a collective space to develop their ideas and priorities.  In the seminal manifesto
“New Voice of La Raza: Chicanas Speak Out” produced in 1971, Argentinian-born socialist feminist Mirta Vidal points out how
Chicana feminists were “beginning to challenge every social institution which contributes to and is responsible for their oppression,
from  inequality  on  the  job  to  their  role  in  the  home.  They  are  questioning  ‘machismo,’  discrimination  in  education,  the  double
standard, the role of the Catholic Church, and all the backward ideology designed to keep women subjugated.”  Vidal and other
feminist writers in the early 1970s argued that Chicanas were subjugated based on their race, as workers, and as women, naming
this phenomenon triple oppression.

As  Chicana  feminists  worked  to  introduce  their  concerns  into  their  respective  movement  spaces,  they  faced  resistance  from
Chicanos and Chicana loyalists who believed that race and class oppression should be the primary agenda and that feminism was
divisive to the movement.  Historian Maylei Blackwell points out that the Chicano movement’s rejection of feminism was due to
its reliance on a vendida logic, that is, “a silencing mechanism used against dissident Chicana activists” by labeling them as:

1.  Agabachas or agringadas (race traitors);
2. Vendidas or malinchistas (sell-outs) dividing the movement from the primary struggle;
3. Marimachas (sexual deviants or lesbians);
4. Inauthentic/outside of/antagonistic to Chicano culture.

Guided by the ideology of Chicanismo, those resistant to Chicana feminist concerns glorified la familia and rigid gender roles that
expected  women  to  bear  children,  care  for  the  household,  and  be  subordinate  to  their  husbands.   Men  and  women  were  also
expected to maintain a gendered division of labor in the movement. Since women were disregarded as real political actors, they
were expected to do things like cook, clean, and perform clerical work. Chicana feminists began calling attention to the fact that
these gendered cultural expectations were first imposed by the colonial Catholic Church during the Spanish conquest and enforced
through  a  dichotomy  that  constructed  women  as  a  ‘mujer  buena’  or  a  ‘mujer  mala,’  otherwise  known  as  the  virgin/whore
complex.
 On one side of the dichotomy is marianismo, the deep reverence for La Virgen de Guadalupe who is valued as the
subservient all-suffering virgin mother. On the other side is the Indigenous woman La Malinche, known for being Hernan Cortes’s
concubine,  translator,  mediator,  and  fabled  mother  of  the  first  mestizo.  As  a  Native  woman,  she  is  characterized  as  sexually
available, disposable, and condemned as a traitor for contributing to the downfall of the Aztec civilization. In modern times, these
doctrines about Chicana womanhood reinforce patriarchy, obliging Chicanas to take on the contradictory roles of obedient wife and
mother and to also be sexually available. But the lived reality of most Chicanas did not afford them the ability to be homemakers.
Because  many  Chicanas  were  working  class  or  lived  in  poverty  and  had  limited  access  to  educational  opportunities,  they  were
compelled to take on low-wage work outside of the home, typically in domestic service or the garment industry, in addition to their
household obligations. Moreover, due to gender discrimination in the workplace, Chicanas tended to earn less than their Chicano
counterparts.

Chicana  lesbian  feminists  who  sought  to  challenge  homophobia  in  addition  to  sexism  faced  intense  backlash  and  were  often
silenced.  In  the  groundbreaking  compilation  Chicana  Feminist  Thought:  The  Basic  Historical  Writings  (1997),  feminist  and
immigration scholar Alma M. García points out that “in a political climate that viewed Chicana feminist ideology with suspicion
and, often, disdain, Chicana feminist lesbians confronted even more strident political attacks.”  However, as El Movimiento began
to transform in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including the emergence of Chicano/a studies, the academic arm of the movement,
Chicana  lesbian  feminist  writing  and  cultural  production  flourished,  further  advancing  Chicana  feminist  thought  and  activist
priorities, which will be explored in Section ## 5.6: Activist Scholarship and Chicana and Latina Studies.

As El Movimiento was underway, so was the mainstream women’s movement, which sought to secure equal rights and access for
women.
 Many Chicanas found the women’s movement agenda to be insufficient as it centered white middle-class and upper-class
feminist perspectives and excluded considerations of race and class oppression. They found conventional white feminist views to
be limited for focusing too narrowly on all men as the enemy, whereas Chicanas felt that colonization and structural oppression
were  the  real  issues.  Not  only  did  Chicanas  speak  out  against  sexism,  but  they  also  spoke  out  against  racism  and  elitism  in  the
women’s movement––what Angela Davis has called “bourgeois feminism.” Many Chicana feminists found that these experiences
mirrored those of other women of color in the U.S., which in part, facilitated the building of strategic coalitions. Their goal was not
to establish a unified position, but rather, to develop an ability to dialogue across lines of difference and come together to address
important issues.

Developing a U.S. Third World Feminist Consciousness and Praxis

Since the late 1960s, Latinas have constructed a feminist standpoint not only in resistance to patriarchal ethnic nationalism and U.S.
hegemonic  feminism,  but  also  in  solidarity  with  an  emerging  U.S.  Third  World  feminist  consciousness  informed  by  global
decolonial and anticolonial movements. As they critiqued and attempted to dismantle interlocking systems of oppression through
racially specific feminist projects, feminists of color in the U.S. created a new cross-racial political subjectivity and oppositional
praxis,  that  is,  putting  theory  into  action,  that  linked  various  struggles  for  social  justice.  María  Cotera  argues,  “Because  Latina
feminists  (like  other  women  of  color  feminists)  understand  feminism  in  relationship  to  other  struggles  for  liberation  and
decolonization, their approach to ‘women’s liberation’ necessarily moves beyond gender, just as their commitment to end racism
and colonialism moves beyond race and nation.”  Figure 5.1.2, “Solidarity With All Movements,” demonstrates the throughline of
this  standpoint  by  illustrating  the  work  of  Dissenters,  a  contemporary  youth-led  national  anti-militarism  movement  organization

that  prioritizes  solidarity  with  other  liberatory  grassroots  movements.  The  sign  in  the  image  says  “We  work  in  solidarity  with
everyday  people  impacted  by  U.S.  wars  and  militarism.  We  prioritize  solidarity  with  the  demands  of  grassroots  liberatory
movements wherever possible, not state powers.” The caption in large bold letters reads “Solidarity with people and movements.”

Women  of  color  developed  new  forms  of  consciousness  characterized  by  critiques  of  capitalism,  economic  exploitation,
imperialism, and war, grounded in international solidarity. Chicanas and Latinas in particular drew inspiration from 20th-century
Latin American and Mexican feminisms and women’s revolutionary participation. They also developed their praxis by traveling to
international  conferences  such  as  the  Indochinese  Women’s  Conference  in  1971  in  Vancouver,  Canada  as  part  of  the  antiwar
 Also instrumental in the development of a U.S. Third World feminist consciousness and praxis were the multiracial multi-

issue print communities, such as those established through Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, founded in 1980 by Black and
Chicana  lesbian  feminists.  Kitchen  Table  published  several  seminal  texts  including  This  Bridge  Called  My  Back:  Writings  by
Radical  Women  of  Color,  edited  by  Cherríe  Moraga  and  Gloria  Anzaldá  (1981),  Home  Girls:  A  Black  Feminist  Anthology  by
Barbara Smith (1983), I Am Your Sister: Black Women Organizing Across Sexualities by Audre Lorde (1985), Apartheid USA: Our
Common  Enemy,  Our  Common  Cause:  Freedom  Organizing  in  the  Eighties  by  Audre  Lorde  and  Merle  Woo  (1985),  and  The
Combahee River Collective Statement: Black Feminist Organizing in the Seventies and Eighties (1986).

Emerging Movements and Ongoing Activism

While Chicana and Latina feminists share some commonalities, like their respective movements, they too had divergent ideologies,
agendas, and priorities. García points out how:

Chicana  feminist  thought  evolved  with  several  divergent,  often  competing,  views.  Chicana  feminists  confronted  divisions
based  on  social  class,  particularly  the  division  between  academic  women  and  grass  roots  community  women,  sexual
orientation,  political  strategies,  political  goals  and  objectives,  the  relationship  between  autonomous  Chicana  feminist
organizations  and  white  women’s  feminist  organizations,  and  their  relationships  with  Chicano  organizations  and  Chicano
men in general.

Likewise, Blackwell notes that as political subjects with multiple identities, women of color organizing often takes on the following
features: “(1) multiple issues in one movement, (2) an intersectional understanding of power and oppression, and (3) the tendency
to work in and between movements.”  Due to the complex nature and scale of Chicana/Latina activism, it would be impossible to

cover  every  cause  that  Chicana  and  Latina  feminists  have  participated  in  since  the  late  1960s.  Therefore,  four  predominant  and
interrelated  issues  have  been  selected  and  will  be  introduced  in  the  following  sections.  These  include  economic  justice,
reproductive justice, cultural activism, and family dynamics.

 Artivist Spotlight: Mujeres de Maiz

Founded  in  1997  Mujeres  de  Maiz  (MdM),  or  women  of  the  corn,  is  an  unapologetic  Xicana-Indígena  led  spiritual  artivist
(artist-activist) organization and movement by and for women and feminists of color whose mission is “to bring together and
empower diverse women and girls through the creation of community spaces that provide holistic wellness through education,
programming, exhibition, and publishing.” Early on, founders and core members participated in the Encuentro Cultural Xicano
Indígena  por  la  Humanidad  y  Contra  el  Neo-liberalismo  with  the  Indigenous  Zapatista  Mayan  community  of  Oventic.  As  a
result, Zapatista philosophy significantly influences their artivist praxis, particularly the emphasis on building alliances with
exploited and marginalized communities around the world.

Every spring MdM publishes a new issue of Flor y Canto, their poetry and arts zine, which is released at the Live Art Show, an
intercultural,  intergenerational,  multimedia  event  that  combines  elements  of  an  art  exhibit,  live  performances,  and  ritual
ceremony featuring women of color musicians, dancers, visual artists, poets, actors, filmmakers, and spiritual healers. Other
community events hosted by MdM include the mujer mercado, poetry night event, film screenings, women’s ceremonies such
as  the  monthly  Coyolxauhqui  full  moon  circle,  and  workshops,  held  in  person  and  virtually,  with  topics  ranging  from  art
making,  creative  writing,  gardening,  self-defense,  and  women’s  health,  often  in  collaboration  with  other  feminist  of  color
organizations and groups from the Eastside of Los Angeles such as Justice for my Sister, Af3irm, Hood Herbalism, and WE
RISE LA, to name a few.

 The mainstream women’s movement of the late 1960s and 1970s has been defined as expressing at least three distinct positions:
liberal feminists who sought access to power and advanced social standing equal to men’s, radical feminists who viewed men as
having access to power and responsible for women’s oppression, and liberation feminists who believed women’s oppression was

## 5.2: Fighting for Economic Justice

Labor Organizing

Chicanas and Latinas have an extensive history of working to improve the material conditions of their communities through their
participation as both rank-and-file workers and leaders in the ongoing labor movement powerfully emerging in the 20th century.
These historical efforts are presented in eight and a half minutes in Video 5.2.1 "Latinas in the Labor Movement."

The  fight  for  economic  justice  continued  in  May  1972  when  4,000  garment  factory  workers,  predominantly  Mexican  American
women,  walked  out  of  their  jobs  at  Farah  Manufacturing  Company  plants  in  Texas  and  Júarez,  Mexico  after  six  workers  were
illegally fired for union activity. In 1970 the majority of the workers voted to unionize with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of
America (ACWA) for higher wages, maternity leave, workplace safety, and an end to sexual harassment, but management refused
to recognize their efforts. According to labor organizer and journalist Kim Kelly, “Immigrant women of color make up the bulk of
the garment industry’s workforce, both in the U.S. and globally, and are forced to bear the brunt of its dangerous conditions, low
pay,  and  high-volume  output.  Through  decades  of  organizing,  strikes,  and  knock-down,  drag-out  fights,  they  have  worked  to
change that status quo and push back against an industry that devalues their humanity and their labor in equal measure.”

The  president  of  the  company  William  ‘Willie’  Farah  was  a  staunch  anti-union  employer  who  relied  on  Red Scare  tactics  in  an
attempt  to  denigrate  and  delegitimize  union  efforts  by  associating  unionization  with  communism  and  firing  union  organizers,
among other retaliatory union-busting tactics. The company went as far as running down strikers with their trucks and during the
first  week  of  the  strike  Farah  management  hired  “private  guards  to  harass  the  women  on  the  picket  line  and  menace  them  with
unmuzzled dogs.”

Strikers  were  protesting  exploitative  working  conditions  including  having  their  already  low  wages  docked  if  they  did  not  meet
increasing quotas, being denied bathroom access to meet the quotas, which caused bladder and kidney infections, poor ventilation
that  resulted  in  a  variety  of  respiratory  illnesses,  and  generally  hazardous  conditions.
  Because  women  did  not  have  maternity
leave  and  could  not  afford  to  go  without  pay,  “women  sometimes  gave  birth  in  the  company  clinic.” The  racialized  gendered
oppression that Chicanas faced at Farah was also present within their union. Rank-and-file women workers often complained that
the  male  leadership  did  not  address  their  specific  needs  and  demands  as  women.  As  the  strike  went  on  and  their  input  ignored,
women’s  disappointment  grew,  leading  some  Farah  workers  in  El  Paso  to  form  Unidad  Para  Siempre,  a  separate  caucus  that
promoted the movement in their vision.

 With the support of religious leaders and major labor unions across the
Despite these obstacles, the Chicana strikers persisted.
country, including the United Farm Workers, they called for a national boycott of Farah pants guided by the rallying cry, “Viva La
Huelga––Don’t  Buy  Farah  Pants!”  The  boycott  poster,  demonstrated  in  Figure  5.2.1,  featured  Rosa  Flores  from  San  Antonio,
Texas, one of the first Farah workers to sign a union card and publicly announce her pro-union stance on the factory floor. The
boycott  transformed  the  local  strike  into  a  national  issue,  resulting  in  a  $20  million  decline  in  Farah’s  annual  revenue,  putting
immense pressure on the manufacturer.

Figure 5.2.1: “Viva la Huelga/Don’t buy Farah pants!” by Philip and Jeff Foisie, Smithsonian is in the Public Domain, CC0.

The text on the poster reads, "Viva La Huelga. Don't Buy Farah Pants! Support the strike. Help give a taste of justice to thousands
of Mexican-American workers at the giant Farah pants company in Texas and New Mexico. These people have lived too long with
the bitter taste of injustice and oppression. The American dream should be theirs to share, too. Their employer, the Farah Company,
makes the dream seem more like a nightmare. The U.S. Government has found Farah guilty of firing workers because they want to
join a union. But the company continues to break the law. And the mammoth manufacturer has instigated the arrests of over 700
strikers. Many were taken from their homes in the middle of the night. All had to post exorbitant bail. Most of them are charged
with standing too close together on the picket line in the first days of the strike. The strikers had been peaceful. In fact, the only
threat of violence has come from the unmuzzled police dogs the armed Farah Company guards now use to patrol the plant (and to
intimidate the strikers). Show the Farah workers America's heart is still in the right place. Show the world American consumers
won't buy injustice. Don't buy Farah pants. Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, AFL-CIO."

After twenty-two months of striking and a successful national boycott, the strikers finally earned their right to unionize in 1974,

wages, health benefits, job security, and seniority rights. The material success was short-lived, however, as the 1970s marked the
onset  of  deindustrialization  with  numerous  U.S.  manufacturing  plants,  including  Farah,  closing  shop  and  moving  production
overseas and across the border to Mexico where labor rights and environmental laws were even more lax. The lasting effects of the

emboldened them to take a more politically active role in their communities and to challenge repressive gender norms both at work
and  at  home.
  The  Chicana  organizers  of  the  Farah  Manufacturing  Strike  contributed  to  the  ongoing  labor  movement  and
unionization efforts that characterized the better part of the 20th century. Today, Latinas who work full time year-round earn 57
cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men.

 The struggle for economic justice continues.

Welfare Rights

Another arena where Chicanas and Latinas were actively involved in economic justice efforts was the movement for welfare rights.
Deindustrialization led to an economic downturn in postwar Los Angeles characterized by high unemployment and poverty rates,
particularly  experienced  by  women  of  color,  many  of  whom  had  previously  migrated  to  Southern  California  for  employment
opportunities during the WWII industrial boom. Demographic shifts and policy changes that made it easier to qualify for aid in the

1950s and 1960s led to an increase in African American and Mexican American welfare recipients, which “was met by a racist
backlash  against  families  of  color,  cuts  to  welfare  budgets,  and  punitive  disciplinary  measures  to  control  the  behavior  of  poor
mothers.”  Discriminatory laws and policies were rationalized through depictions of Latinas, Native American women, and Black
women in the media and public policy discourse as dependent on the government, abusing welfare aid, and sexually promiscuous
(For more on this topic visit “The Backlash and Disinvestment in Public Education” in Section 8.3: Re-imagining Education in an
Era of Revolt, 1955-1975).  Women  of  color  faced  systemic  denial  of  services  and  unconstitutional  practices  such  as  warrantless
home searches, being “compelled to answer caseworkers’ intrusive questions about their sexuality and personal behavior,” pressure
“to  undergo  sterilization  or  give  up  their  babies  for  adoption,”  and  having  their  children  placed  into  foster  care,  limiting  their
reproductive choices, personal autonomy, and human rights.

Despite  this  demeaning  treatment,  welfare  recipients  fought  back.  The  Los  Angeles  County  Welfare  Rights  Organization
(LAWRO)  developed  from  the  collaborative  efforts  of  Mexican  American  and  African  American  women  in  the  1950s  whose
efforts  grew  into  a  “multiracial  coalition  of  neighborhood-based  AFDC  recipient  groups”  who  fought  against  economic
marginalization in the 1960s and 1970s.
 Many Welfare Rights Organizations formed across the nation and were brought together
in June 1966 by the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), of which Black and Puerto Rican women were instrumental,
for the first national day of action for welfare rights. People marched in Washington D.C., Baltimore, and New York City, as well
as  in  Los  Angeles  where  Mexican  American,  Puerto  Rican,  African  American,  and  white  women  and  children  demanded  job
training, quality jobs, childcare, and dignity for families on public assistance. The women of LAWRO, inspired by the broader civil
rights struggles and power movements around them, provided know-your-rights workshops in the community, demanded a voice in
welfare policy, provided social support for one another, and organized countywide campaigns and mass public demonstrations.

In Los Angeles, Chicanas and Black women organized separate but akin organizations in their respective neighborhoods and came
together  to  form  a  countywide  alliance  of  various  independent  WRO  groups.  They  built  coalitions  around  poverty,  welfare,  and
motherhood,  forging  a  common  Brown-Black  movement  that  honored  racial  and  ethnic  autonomy  while  enabling  cross-racial
solidarity.  Chicanas  were  important  activists  and  leaders  from  the  beginning  of  the  welfare  rights  movement,  including  Alicia
Escalante, a poor single mother of five who founded the prominent East Los Angeles Welfare Rights Organization (ELAWRO) in
1967, later known as the Chicana Welfare Rights Organization (CWRO).

 Activist Spotlight: Alicia Escalante

Alicia Escalante’s story is exceptional but not uncommon. Born and raised in the 1930s and 1940s in El Chamizal, a Mexican
barrio in El Paso, Texas, Escalante grew up in poverty with her abusive father. As a youth, she fled to California to be with her
mother where she witnessed the cruelty of the welfare and medical systems firsthand. These formative experiences, coupled
with the fact that as a teenager she needed to work to sustain her household, shaped her political consciousness, leading her to
become an advocate for her mother and later for herself and her own family as well as members of her community. Ecalente’s
activism  was  rooted  in  an  ethic  of  love  and  care  for  the  people  around  her,  eventually  leading  her  to  found  the  East  Los
Angeles Welfare Rights Organization in 1967 (later known as the Chicana Welfare Rights Organization) and La Causa de Los
Pobres, the organization’s newspaper. Characterized by her growing empowerment and personal sense of agency, “Escalante
and  the  [ELAWRO]  challenged  the  status  quo  of  the  welfare  system  by  providing  informational  services  to  recipients,
representation during fair hearings (meetings to appeal decisions made by the welfare department), and direct engagement with
the local and state bureaucracy to ensure that recipients rights were respected and upheld.”  The organization ran workshops
on  welfare  policies,  advocated  for  welfare  forms  in  Spanish  and  additional  local  offices  staffed  with  bilingual  Mexican
American  caseworkers,  and  worked  for  humane  public  policy  at  the  county,  state,  and  federal  levels.  While  advocating  for
recipients in East Los Angeles, Escalante frequently collaborated with Black women activists Johnnie Tillmon and Catherine
Jermany  on  countywide  campaigns.  Escalante  was  also  involved  in  other  facets  of  the  Chicano  Movement,  supporting  and
participating  in  the  East  Los  Angeles  high  school  blowouts,  the  anti-war  movement,  and  the  Poor  People’s  Campaign  in
Washington D.C. A prolific writer and orator, Escalante demanded dignity for poor single Chicana mothers on welfare, a group
relegated to the margins in both the Chicano movement and the welfare rights movement.

school students, college students, graduate students, and young community activists. Two resolutions emerged from the conference
that “called for free, legal abortions and birth control for the Chicano community; controlled by Chicanas” and “24-hour childcare
centers  in  Chicano  communities,”  pointing  out  that  “Chicana  motherhood  should  not  preclude  educational,  political,  social  and
economic development.”  Prior to the passage of Roe v. Wade, intense debates took place among Chicanas at major workshops and
conferences  on  the  topic  of  legal  abortion.  Despite  their  varying  positions,  many  resolutions  did  pass  in  support,  like  the  one
mentioned previously, often calling for Chicana bodily autonomy and community-run clinics that could provide culturally relevant
medical care, health education, birth control, and abortion services.

Chicanas, like other feminists of color, have long-expressed a wide range of concerns when it comes to reproductive health and
justice  including  issues  of  “population  control,  sterilization  abuse,  unsafe  contraceptives,  welfare  reform,  the  criminalization  of

A Brief History of Reproductive (In)justice

Reproductive  justice  activism  arises  from  resistance  to  a  long  history  of  systematic  reproductive  subjugation,  particularly  in
Indigenous, Black, Latinx, poor, and disabled communities, dating back to the Spanish and English colonial eras and into the 20th
century  under  U.S.  eugenics  laws,  programs,  and  policies.  Unfortunately,  reproductive  medical  violence  continues  today,
particularly among incarcerated and low-income communities of color.
 One contemporary example is the forced sterilization of
incarcerated immigrant women in 2020 at the privately operated Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Georgia.

For most of the 20th century, Mexican American and Puerto Rican women faced widespread forced and coercive sterilization and
gynecological medical experimentation by the U.S. government and private doctors, who were often subsidized by the government.
For  example,  the  birth  control  pill  was  first  tested  on  unconsenting  poor  women  in  Puerto  Rico  in  the  1950s,  resulting  in  three
deaths, followed by decades of forced sterilization. As noted in Section ## 5.4: Cultural Activism,  Chicanas  and  Latinas  have  been
subjected  to  racist  and  sexist  stereotypes  about  their  sexuality  and  reproduction,  which  have  served  as  justifications  for
discriminatory, often violent, policies and practices. This pervasive subjection to reproductive exploitation propelled Chicanas and
Latinas into legal, legislative, and grassroots activism in the 1960s and 1970s.

As  with  other  movements  discussed  in  this  chapter,  Chicana  and  Puerto  Rican  women  had  to  contend  with  the  patriarchal
ideologies  that  undergirded  their  nationalist  movements  as  well  as  the  racist  and  classist  ideologies  of  the  women’s  liberation
movement.  Within  many  ethnic-based  nationalist  ideologies,  women  were  expected  to  bear  many  children  in  order  to  produce
future  revolutionaries  for  the  movement  and  abortion  was  recognized  as  part  of  a  larger  state-sanctioned  campaign  of  cultural
genocide. While Puerto Rican and Chicano nationalists ultimately denounced reproductive abuses, two organizations took different
positions on the issue of abortion. Puerto Rican women were able to integrate the struggle for reproductive rights into the Young
Lords  Party  Platform,  resulting  in  the  establishment  of  community-run  clinics  in  New  York  that  offered  a  wide  range  of  birth
control options, including abortion services.
 The Brown Berets also opened community clinics in Los Angeles, but the group was
steadfast in their opposition to abortion, claiming that all forms of birth control were tools of genocide, leading Chicanas to form
feminist caucuses within existing organizations as well as separate reproductive rights groups.

Reproductive Justice Organizations

Both Puerto Rican and Chicana activists joined with other Latinas and women of color across the country to wage legal battles in
their  fight  for  reproductive  justice.  Latinas  on  the  East  Coast  formed  the  multi-ethnic  coalition  Committee  to  End  Sterilization
Abuse  (CSEA)  in  1974  and  in  Los  Angeles,  Chicana  and  Mexicana  activists  filed  a  civil  suit  against  the  Los  Angeles  County
Medical Center for involuntary sterilization practices, who subsequently turned to CSEA for assistance. Local grassroots efforts of
the 1960s and 1970 developed into more formal national-level Latina and multi-racial organizations in the 1980s and 1990s such as
the  Latina  Roundtable  on  Health  and  Reproductive  Rights  (LRHRR)  founded  in  1989  by  mostly  Puerto  Rican  and  Dominican
women, Amigas Latinas en Acción formed in the 1990s in Boston, the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health (NLIRH),
and the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights (COLOR).

 Organization Spotlight: California Latinas for Reproductive Justice

Founded in 2004, California Latinas for Reproductive Justice  (CLRJ)  is  a  statewide  organization  committed  to  honoring  the
experiences of Latinas/xs to uphold our dignity, our bodies, sexuality, and families. We build Latinas’/xs’ power and cultivate
leadership through community education, policy advocacy, and community-informed research to achieve reproductive justice.
At CLRJ we recognize that Latinas’/xs’ reproductive health and rights cannot be viewed in isolation. So we do our work using
the reproductive justice framework that emphasizes the intersection with other social, economic and community-based issues
that promote the social justice and human rights of Latina/x women and girls and the Latinx community as a whole.

In other words, we recognize that Latinas/xs’ access to culturally and linguistically appropriate health care, a living wage job,
quality education, freedom from discrimination and violence, among many other issues that affect Latinas’/xs’ daily lives, have
a  profound  effect  on  Latinas’  reproductive  and  sexual  health,  as  well  as  our  right  to  self-determination  in  all  aspects  of  our
lives.

We  advance  our  mission  through  four  core  strategies:  1)  Policy  Advocacy,  2)  Community  Engagement,  3)  Community-
Informed Research, and 4) Strategic Communications. In addition to these core strategies, an important value that permeates all
aspects of CLRJ’s work is that of working in collaboration with other allies who share our commitment toward promoting the
health and justice of our communities, including grassroots activists, community leaders, and coalitions, policymakers, policy
advocates and researchers.

## 5.4: Cultural Activism

Chicana Artivists Confront Disempowering Representations

Chicana  feminist  artists  and  scholars  have  long-challenged  gender  oppression  during  and  since  the  Chicano  Renaissance––the
flowering of arts, literature, and cultural production alongside El Movimiento. Writers such as Lorna Dee Cervantes, Ana Castillo,
Gloria Anzaldúa, and Cherríe Moraga, performance artists Patssi Valdez of ASCO and Patricia Valencia, and visual artists Ester
Hernandez, Santa Barraza, and Yolanda López, among others, have confronted disempowering representations of racialized women
and reenvisioned Mexican/Chicanx cultural archetypes through their cultural production. Two figures, in particular, La Virgen de
Guadalupe  and  La  Malinche  have  been  reclaimed  and  redefined  by  Chicana  feminists,  challenging  the  patriarchal  ‘mujer
buena/mujer mala’ dichotomy that structures women’s and girl’s everyday lives. These artivists (artist-activists)  understood  that
mythologies and cultural stories transmit values, determine desirable and undesirable traits, and shape behavior, making their work
not merely art for its own sake, but deeply political.

Redefining Guadalupe

Many artists have transformed Guadalupe’s image from a chaste, docile, martyr into an empowered feminist icon. One of the first
revisionist  images  was  an  etching  by  San  Francisco-based  visual  artist  Ester  Hernandez  in  1975.  “La  Virgen  de  Guadalupe
Defendiendo los Derechos de los Xicanos,” displayed in Figure 5.4.1, features a young Guadalupe with an unwavering gaze framed
by her long dark hair. She is dressed in a black belt karate uniform, her fists clenched, and one leg is powerfully kicking towards
anyone or anything who would harm los Xicanos. Hernandez received praise and backlash for her artwork, including death threats,
as  did  Los  Angeles-based  multimedia  artist  Alma  López  for  the  digital  collage  “Our  Lady”  created  nearly  25  years  later,
displayed  in  Figure  5.4.2.  Like  Hernández,  López  portrayed  the  Catholic  icon  as  a  modern,  familiar,  corporeal  woman.  López’s
version  is  a  poised  brown-skinned  Virgen  adorned  in  roses  and  a  Coyolxauhqui  cape,  with  hands-on-hips  and  a  gaze  intently
focused  on  the  viewer.  She  stands  barefoot  on  a  black  crescent  moon  held  up  by  a  bare-breasted  female  cherub  with  monarch
butterfly wings. The print was part of the CyberArte: Tradition Meets Technology exhibition at the Museum of International Folk
Art (MOIFA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2001. Organized attempts to censor the image were led by Roman Catholic clergy and
Chicano nationalists who claimed the piece was overtly sexual and therefore sacrilegious. News of the controversy spread online
across  the  U.S.  and  Mexico,  consequently  making  López  and  her  apparition  world-famous.  Through  artistic  reimagining,  López
created a cultural sign of queer Chicana desire––an action that has been taken up by many other Chicana artists, which is often met
with hostility.

Reenvisioning Malintzín

Another icon has been central in feminist cultural activism. The story of La Malinche, also known as Malintzín Tenepal, Malinalli,
and Doña Marina, has been taken up in a number of essays, poems, and artwork in divergent ways. Chicana author and publisher
Norma Alarcón points out that Chicano and Mexicano men’s representation of La Malinche is vastly different than that of Chicana
feminists. Men’s patriarchal interpretations of Malinche tend to focus on her betrayal vis-à-vis her sexuality, assigning the role of

servitude  to  Chicanas/Mexicanas,  particularly  those  in  heterosexual  relationships.  Embodied  by  La  Malinche,  betrayal  itself  is
coded as female. Alarcón argues that Malintzín has become a “reference point not only for controlling, interpreting or visualizing
women but also to wage a domestic battle of stifling proportions.”  The impacts of this myth are vast. As the primary transmitters
of  culture,  women  are  not  exempt  from  reproducing  misogynistic  representations,  which  can  manifest  as  self-hatred.  If  we  are
expected to love and emulate Guadalupe and her virtues, according to binary thinking we must hate and reject La Malinche and
those aspects within ourselves that we share. These are the representations of La Malinche that Chicana feminists have sought to
undo and revise.

In Infinite Divisions: An Anthology of Chicana Literature Tey Diana Rebolledo and Eliana S. Rivero (1993) identify four themes
that describe the work of Chicanas who have written about Malintzín. These include

1. Refusal to blame the victim. Malintzín was an Indigenous woman who was sold into slavery by her family and later taken

captive by the conquistador Cortes. She was a victim of both historical and political circumstances.

2. Representative of the conquest of Indigenous Mexico. The revival of Malintzín as central to the process of mestizaje elevates

her to the status of the cultural mother, a complex woman representing Chicanas/os Native roots.

3. Translation and code-switching. Chicana writers identify parallels in their own experiences with those of Malinche as a
translator and cultural intermediary. She too was caught between two worlds––her own culture and that of the dominant
Spanish settler culture. Chicanas identify with acts of cultural and linguistic negotiation and interpretation.

4. Agency and survival. Chicana writers reinterpret Malintzín’s story in a more nuanced way, pointing out that although she was
young and enslaved, she was an active subject who made conscious decisions that shaped her own life and made history, not
simply a passive victim of sexual conquest. In fact, “it is in her capacity as intercessor and helper that La Malinche takes on the
attributes of the Virgin of Guadalupe.”

Two  noteworthy  poetic  examples  include  “Como  Duele”  by  Adalijza  Sosa-Riddell  and  “La  Malinche”  by  Carmen  Tafolla,
composed in 1973 and 1978 respectively. They are part of a larger body of work that emerged during El Movimiento that seek to
reformulate Chicana identity, history, and cultural politics. In the post-movement years, La Virgen de Guadalupe and La Malinche
continue to be powerful symbols of Chicana representation.

 Sidebar: Poetry

“Como Duele” by Adalijza Sosa-Riddell

Ese, vato, I saw you today          [Hey, buddy]
en Los y Sacra
en Santa Barbara, Sanfra
and everywhere else.
You walked, Chicano chulo,
eagle on your jacket,
y “carnales y carnalas,”                [brothers and sisters]
Y “Que Viva la Raza.”

But where were you when
I was looking for myself?
As if I didn't know.

Where the MAN and
all his pendejadas?                      [stupidity]
sent you,
     To Dartmouth, Los Angeles City College,
     Barbers School, La Pinta,
     Korea, and Vietnam; too many of you
     returned wrapped como enchiladas
     in red, white, and blue.

A Chicano at Dartmouth?
I was at Berkeley, where,
there were too few of us

and even less of you.
I'm not even sure
that I really looked for you.

I heard from many rucos               [old people]
that you
would never make it.
You would hold me back;
From What?
From what we are today?
“Y QUE VIVA”
Pinche, como duele ser Malinche.   [How it hurts to be Malinche]

My name was changed, por la ley.  [by the law]
Probrecitos, they believed in me,
That I was white enough
to stay forever,
that I would never find you again.

I found you, Chicano,
but only for a moment,
Never para siempre.                      [forever]
Temilotzin died the morning after,
Malinche.
It's too late.

The world does not wait
for indecision,
neither do Chicanos.

And mis pobres padres                   [my poor parents]
taught me
not to hurt
others too much,
Malinche, pinche,
forever with me;
     I was born out of you,
     I walk beside you,
     bear my children with you,
     for sure, I’ll die
     alone with you.
Perhaps I died before,
when I said good-bye
al barrio y al Cruiser.
He went to road camp,
por grifo y peleonero.                      [for drugs and fighting]
While I was saved––
for what?

Pinche, como duele ser Malinche.
Pero sabes, ese,
what keeps me from shattering
into a million fragments?
It's that sometimes,
you are el hijo de la Malinche, too.

“La Malinche” by Carmen Tafolla

Yo soy la Malinche.

My people called me Malintzín Tenepal
the Spaniards called me Doña Marina

I came to be known as Malinche
     and Malinche came to mean traitor.

they called me––chingada
                                        Chingada.
(Ha––¡Chingada! ¡Screwed!)

         Of noble ancestry, for whatever that means,
I was sold into slavery by MY ROYAL FAMILY––so
that my brother could get my inheritance.

…And then the omens began––a god, a new civi-
lization, the downfall of our empire.
         And you came.
         My dear Hernán Cortés, to share your “civi-

lization”––to play a god, . . . and I began to dream…
                                                  I saw
                                                    and I acted.

I saw our world
          And I saw yours
                    And I saw––
                                        another.

And yes––I helped you––against Emperor Moctezuma
Xocoyotzín himself.
I became Interpreter, Advisor, and lover.
          They could not imagine me dealing on a level
                         with you––so they said I was raped, used
                                                            chingada
                                                                ¡Chingada!

But I saw our world
                    and your world
                              and another.

No one else could see.
         Beyond one world, none existed.
And you yourself cried the night
the city burned
     and burned at your orders.
The most beautiful city on earth
                                   in flames,
You cried broken tears the night you saw
                                   your destruction.
My homeland ached within me
                    (but I saw another).

Another world––
          a world yet to be born.
And our child was born…
          and I was immortalized Chingada!

Years later, you took away my child (my sweet
mestizo new world child)
          to raise him in your world
          You still didn’t see.
                    You still didn’t see.
And history would call me
                                             Chingada.

But Chingada I was not.
          Not tricked, not screwed, not traitor.
For I was not traitor to myself––
          I saw a dream
                    and I reached it.
                                   Another world………

                                                                 la raza.
                                                                  la raaaaa-zaaaaa………

## 5.5: Disrupting Sexism and Homophobia en La Familia

Political Familism

While the ideological concept of la familia had some negative implications for Chicanas, one positive attribute was the call for total
family participation in the struggle for racial justice. In her seminal 1975 sociological study, Chicana feminist Maxine Baca Zinn
 She challenges the sociological literature that, at the time,
calls this fusion of cultural and political resistance political familism.
attributed  burgeoning  egalitarian  Chicano  family  dynamics  to  assimilation,  instead  arguing  that  family  activism  in  general  and
Chicana participation in movement activities, in particular, brought about dramatic shifts in gender roles while enabling Chicanos
to  maintain  familial  ties.  In  fact,  Baca  Zinn  claims  that  historically,  the  family  has  been  a  source  of  protection  and  refuge  for
Chicanos/as  in  a  hostile  racist  society  and  the  maintenance  of  the  extended  family  kinship  system  is  in  direct  opposition  to  the
dominant colonial nuclear family structure. In other words, women’s participation in El Movimiento transformed their relationship
to the family and to other’s gendered expectations of them.

Expanding Notions of La Familia

Additionally,  romanticized  notions  of  la  familia  were  further  disrupted  by  the  Chicana  Welfare  Rights  Organization,  whose
activism centered poor single Chicana mothers on welfare, unsettling the idea that the Chicano family was constituted by a male
head-of-household in a heterosexual partnership. Similarly, critiques of Chicano heterosexism were taking place in the political and
creative work of Chicana feminist lesbians such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Ana Castillo, Naomi Littlebear Moreno, and Cherríe Moraga.
In her groundbreaking essay “Queer Aztlán,” Moraga  calls for more expansive notions of la familia, expressing a desire for “a new
nationalism in which la Chicana Indígena stands at the center, and heterosexism and homophobia are no longer the cultural order of
the  day.”   While  Chicanismo  called  for  the  involvement  of  la  familia  to  challenge  oppressive  external  conditions,  Chicana
feminists  extended  this  view  to  include  oppressive  intracultural  conditions,  namely  sexism  and  homophobia,  within  la  familia
itself,  demonstrating  the  feminist  principle  that  the  “personal  is  political.”  Chicana  feminists  worked  to  expand  and  reframe  the
notion of la familia as an important unit that could collectively demand liberation for all its members. Writer and activist Enriqueta
Longeaux y Vásquez put it this way: “look at each other as one large family. We must look at all of the children as belonging to all
of us. We must strive for the fulfillment of all as equals, with the capacity and right to develop as humans."

## 5.6: Activist Scholarship and Chicana and Latina Studies

Fighting for a Feminist Agenda in Chicano Studies

As noted throughout this chapter, Chicana/Latina feminist activism has taken place in homes, in the streets, at the workplace, and in
cultural production. Chicana/Latina feminists have also been active in academia. As noted in Chapter # 8: Education and Activism,
the number of people of color entering higher education increased as a direct result of student and community activism in the 1960s
and  1970s.  Activists  called  for  a  more  relevant  education  that  highlighted  their  community’s  knowledge  systems,  histories,
struggles,  and  contributions,  leading  to  the  formation  of  ethnic  studies  programs  and  departments  across  the  country.  The  first
Chicano studies programs that emerged out of El Movimiento were guided by the ideology of Chicanismo, often suppressing topics
of  gender  and  sexuality,  leaving  feminist  and  queer  faculty  and  students  to  address  the  oppressive  aspects  of  the  burgeoning
discipline. In this section, we explore stories of the trailblazing activist scholars who fought to include a feminist agenda within
Chicano studies and establish the field of Chicana/Latina studies.

At a joint Chicano studies/MEChA conference at California State University, Northridge in 1972, a resolution passed that called for
all  Chicano  studies  majors  to  take  at  least  one  course  on  “La  Chicana”  for  graduation  and  in  June  1973,  the  first  Chicana
curriculum  was  developed  for  colleges  and  universities  (adaptable  for  high  schools)  at  a  Chicana  workshop  at  the  University  of
California, Los Angeles. During this time, activist-scholar and journalist Anna NietoGomez called for Chicana-specific classes to
be developed that would provide Chicanas a space to develop a new empowered identity and facilitate others’ understanding and
acceptance of her new role in society. She would go on to teach one of the first courses on “The Chicana Experience” at California
State  University,  Northridge  and  co-found  the  first  Chicana  feminist  scholarly  journal  Encuentro  Femenil  with  Hijas  de
Cuauhtémoc in 1973.
  From  the  onset,  the  founders  worked  with  community  leaders  to  document  issues  and  struggles  to  build
awareness  and  rally  support.  The  journal  provided  a  space  for  Chicana  cultural  production  and  activist  scholarship,  which  were
then  moved  into  the  classroom,  along  with  manifestos  and  newspapers  from  different  sectors  of  the  movement  and  other
anticolonial and socialist texts.

Post-Movement Feminist and Queer Interventions

After the height of the El Movimiento (1968-1975) and the formative years of Chicana studies, many feminist and queer activists
and  scholars  “abandoned  nationalist  claims  and  nationalist  imaginaries  to  create  alternative  ways  of  belonging.”   The  feminist
struggle  against  sexism  in  Chicano  studies,  while  operative  since  the  inception  of  the  field,  was  on  full  display  at  the  National
Association  for  Chicano  Studies  (NACS)  conference  in  1982  when  Mujeres  en  Marcha,  a  group  of  Chicana  scholars  from  UC
Berkeley, organized a panel on gender inequality.
 The Chicana Caucus of NACS was established the following year. The caucus
focuses on gender equity, sexism, patriarchy, and the needs and interests of women, whether queer or straight, in the association
and in everyday life. Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS), also formed in 1982, is a professional organization for
Chicana/Latina/Indigenous  women  and  gender-expansive  academics  and  activists  “dedicated  to  building  bridges  between
community and university settings, transforming higher education, and promoting new paradigms and methods.” MALCS flagship
biannual  publication,  Chicana/Latina  Studies:  The  Journal  of  Mujeres  Activas  en  Letras  y  Cambio  Social,  “publishes
groundbreaking  interdisciplinary  scholarship,  creative  works  by  and  about  Chicanas/Latinas  and  Indigenous  women  of  the
Americas, and is receptive to all scholarly methods and theoretical perspectives that examine, describe, analyze, or interpret our
experiences.”

Moreover,  Chicana/x  feminist  lesbian  writers  began  emerging  in  greater  numbers  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  Their  work  centered
queer  women’s  perspectives  in  both  fiction  and  non-fiction,  critiqued  heterosexism  and  heteronormativity,  and  addressed  the
exclusion  of  gender  and  sexuality  in  the  field  of  Chicano  studies.  Through  and  despite  the  resistance,  queer  caucuses  were
established at NACS in the early 1990s including the Lesbian Caucus (now Lesbian, BiMujeres, and Trans Caucus) and the Joto
Caucus,  consisting  of  men  who  are  gay,  bisexual,  and  trans.  After  decades  of  feminist  and  queer  interventions,  NACS  finally
changed its name from National Association of Chicano Studies to National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS)
in 1995 and numerous resolutions were passed in the 90s that addressed issues of gender, sexuality, sexism, and homophobia in the
organization.  Over  the  years,  Chicana/o/x  and  Latina/o/x  gender  and  sexuality  have  become  the  fastest-growing  areas  of  study
within  the  field  and  scholarly  and  political  explorations  have  become  more  complex  and  consequential.  Visit  Chapter 6: Jotería
Studies for a history of Jotería studies and a discussion of the activist scholars who have expanded the Chicana/o/x studies canon.
Since the 2000s, NACCS and MALCS have broadened their membership and missions as a result of interventions by Indigenous
Latinxs, Afro-Latinxs, and trans and gender-non-conforming Latinxs. In conclusion, a distinct feature of Chicana/Latina studies is

its  commitment  to  community-engaged  activist  scholarship  that  “links  research  to  community  concerns  and  social  change,”
centering Chicana/xs Latina/xs as multifaceted agent-subjects.

## 5.7: Conclusion

Summary

In  this  chapter  we  explored  a  variety  of  Chicana/Latina  feminist  political,  social,  artistic,  and  scholarly  issues,  movements,  and
practices that have taken shape in a variety of contexts. Chicana/Latina feminists draw inspiration from a long lineage of radical
feminist praxis across the hemisphere and around the world, often building coalitions with other marginalized communities. Some
key issues that were introduced include economic justice, reproductive justice, cultural activism, family dynamics, and scholarship.
However, these are only a few of the many ongoing movements and causes that Chicana/Latina feminists participate in. Hopefully
you  complete  this  chapter  informed  and  inspired  taking  with  you  new  perspectives,  tools,  and  strategies  to  utilize  in  your  own
advocacy work, whether that be in your home, community, school, or beyond.

Ancillary materials for this chapter are located in Section ## 11.5: Chapter 5 Resource Guide, which includes slides, media, writing
and discussion prompts, and suggested assignments and activities.

Key Terms

Patriarchy: A system of gender-based control and domination where women and gender non-conforming people are subordinated
to men through legal and extralegal measures. Patriarchy “includes cultural ideas about men and women, the web of relationships
that structure social life, and the unequal distribution of power, rewards, and resources that underlies privilege and oppression.”

Sexism: Discrimination or devaluation of women, based on their sex or gender.

Triple Oppression: A phenomenon named by feminist writers in the early 1970s who argued that Chicanas were subjugated based
on their race, as workers, and as women. U.S. Third-World, Puerto Rican, and Black feminists were simultaneously theorizing and
organizing around the convergence of multiple systems of oppression, drawing on an intergenerational feminist lineage dating back
hundreds of years.

Loyalists: A designation for Chicanas who were guided by the ideology of Chicanismo and believed that race and class oppression
should be the primary agenda of El Movimiento and that feminism was divisive to the movement.

Dichotomy: A division between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different.

Virgin/Whore Complex: An example of a dichotomy that was first imposed by the colonial Catholic Church during the Spanish
conquest that constructed women as a ‘mujer buena’ or a ‘mujer mala.’ In modern times, this gendered cultural expectation about
Chicana womanhood reinforces patriarchy, obliging Chicanas to take on the contradictory roles of obedient wife and mother and to
also be sexually available.

Marianismo: The narrative found on one side of the virgin/whore complex, which typifies the deep reverence for La Virgen de
Guadalupe who is valued as the subservient all-suffering virgin mother.

La  Malinche:  The  Indigenous  woman  on  one  side  of  the  virgin/whore  complex  known  for  being  Hernan  Cortes’s  concubine,
translator,  mediator,  and  fabled  mother  of  the  first  mestizo.  As  a  Native  woman,  she  is  characterized  as  sexually  available,
disposable, and condemned as a traitor for contributing to the downfall of the Aztec civilization.

U.S. Third World Feminism: A transnational feminist standpoint developed in the late 1960s and informed by global decolonial
and  anticolonial  movements.  As  they  critiqued  and  attempted  to  dismantle  interlocking  systems  of  oppression  through  racially
specific  feminist  projects,  feminists  of  color  in  the  U.S.,  including  Chicanas  and  Latinas,  co-created  a  new  cross-racial  political
subjectivity and oppositional praxis that linked various struggles for social justice.

Praxis: The act of putting theory into action.

Farah Manufacturing Strike: An event that began in May 1972 when 4,000 garment factory workers, predominantly Mexican
American  women,  walked  out  of  their  jobs  at  Farah  Manufacturing  Company  plants  in  Texas  and  Júarez,  Mexico.  The  strikers
demanded the right to unionize for higher wages, maternity leave, workplace safety, and an end to sexual harassment, which they
won after twenty-two months of striking and a successful national boycott.

Alicia  Escalante:  A  prominent  Chicanas  welfare  rights  activist  in  the  1960s  and  leader  in  the  larger  welfare  rights  movement.
Escalante was also involved in other facets of the Chicano Movement, supporting and participating in the East Los Angeles high
school blowouts, the anti-war movement, and the Poor People’s Campaign in Washington D.C.

Chicana  Welfare  Rights  Organization:  Originally  the  East  Los  Angeles  Welfare  Rights  Organization  (ELAWRO),  this
organization was founded in 1967 by Alicia Escalante. The organization ran workshops on welfare policies, advocated for welfare
forms in Spanish and additional local offices staffed with bilingual Mexican American caseworkers, and worked for humane public
policy at the county, state, and federal levels.

La Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza: The first nationwide Chicana feminist conference held in 1971 in Houston, Texas.

Reproductive Justice: An expansive feminist of color standpoint at the intersections of  reproductive health and social justice that
goes  beyond  the  pro-choice  movement’s  singular  commitment  to  legal  abortion  access.  RJ  advocates  for  the  right  to  not  have  a
child, the right to have a child, and the right to parent children in safe and healthy environments. It also demands sexual autonomy
and gender freedom for all.

Artivist: A combination of the words artist and activist. Artivists create art not for its own sake, but to convey a political message
in the service of social justice movements.

Political  Familialism:  A  term  coined  by  Chicana  feminist  sociologist  Maxine  Baca  Zinn  to  describe  the  fusion  of  cultural  and
political resistance during the Chicano Movement demonstrated by the call for total family participation in the struggle for racial
justice.

Activist-Scholar: A term used to describe academics who take an explicitly political standpoint in their work.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 6: Jotería Studies

 Learning Objectives

Define the meanings of jotería and the importance of self-naming.
Explain the genealogy of jotería studies by studying its origins and impact on Chicanx activism, cultural production,
performance, identity, and scholarship.
Describe the relationship between jotería studies and Chicanx studies.
Demonstrate how jotería frameworks help to think critically about gender sexuality, race, and culture.

Introduction

When most students learn about jotería studies for the first time, they are surprised that it is even a thing. Often they say, “isn’t
jotería a negative or derogatory word?” Or they will say with some confusion that they have only ever heard joto used as a way to
offend someone or call them gay. None of those responses are surprising or incorrect. Jotería, joto, and jota have been used, and
continue to be used, in negative and derisive ways in the United States, Mexico, and other Latin American countries. However, like
the word Chicano or queer, which were reclaimed as part of social justice activism, joto, jota, and jotería, have been reclaimed,
redefined,  and  resignified  as  empowering  terms  for  many  people  who  find  pride  and  strength  in  their  queer,  trans,  Chicanx  and
Latinx identities.

Not only have folks reclaimed these words, but there is an entire field of studies called jotería studies and a national organization
called  the  Association  for  Jotería  Arts,  Activism,  and  Scholarship  (AJAAS)  created  in  the  2010s  that  has  helped  shape  the
field.  Courses are being taught in jotería studies at colleges and universities near you, you can find merchandise with the words
jotx written on it, and students and activists are seeing themselves represented more in more and more spaces. None of this would
have been possible, however, without the activism of trans and queer Chicanxs and Latinxs and other people of color who have
fought for visibility, representation, and basic human rights.

In her 1987 book Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Chicana lesbian author, philosopher, poet, and independent scholar,
Gloria Anzaldúa wrote, “People listen to what your jotería is saying,” meaning that cisgender heterosexual Chicanas and Chicanos
needed to pay attention to what queer members of the Chicanx community were saying.   It has taken a long time, but folks are
now  paying  attention.  Privileging  some  of  those  jotería  voices,  this  chapter  traces  the  genealogy  of  jotería  as  an  identity  and
epistemology (way of thinking and knowing) and of the field of jotería studies, which is indebted to Chicana feminisms, women of
color feminists, Chicanx studies, ethnic studies, and activism for women’s, queer, and trans rights. The chapter highlights topics
such as jotería education, pedagogy, activism, art, nightlife, spirituality, sex, and others, and how jotería as a community and as an
academic field have paved an innovative and transformative path for thinking about the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality
in Chicanx and Latinx communities. This is only an introduction as there is so much more to cover than these pages permit. But we
hope this sparks your interest and you continue to learn about jotería!

Footnotes
 Maricón is another derogatory word in the US, Mexico, Cuba, and other parts of Latin America, that has been reclaimed by many
and has been used in art and literature as a banner of pride like Joteria See this article by Ernesto Cuba on the use of the word
maricón. https://latinxtalk.org/2022/03/16/ma...se-of-maricon/

  As  discussed  later  in  the  chapter,  AJAAS  was  formed  when  members  of  the  National  Association  for  Chicana  and  Chicano
Studies (NACCS), Joto Caucus (Gay men’s caucus) and Lesbian, Bi, Mujeres, Trans Caucus, and community members, decided to
create their own organization.

## 6.1: Reclaiming Jota/o/x and Jotería

Etymology of Jota/o/x

I remember being called a joto when I was a kid. It was painful when my cousins, family members who I loved, used that
slur  to  belittle  me  and  dehumanize  me.  I  carried  shame  from  that  for  many  years.  Today  I  have  healed  from  those
experiences. I am proud to be a joto and find beauty in my queerness.

The etymology and meaning of the terms joto/a/x and jotería are important to understand the shift from derogatory insults to terms
of empowerment and the development of jotería studies as an interdisciplinary academic field of study. The term jotería derives
from the colloquial Spanish language term joto (sissy, faggot) for gay men in Mexico and Mexican and Chicanx communities in the
US.   The  word  derives  from  jota  (Cell  Block  J)  of  the  Lecumberri  Federal  Prison  (1900-1976)  in  Mexico  City  where  prison
authorities  kept  effeminate  men  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  prison  population  starting  in  the  early  part  of  the  20th
century.   Prisoners  in  cellblock  J  were  called  jotos  and  the  word  became  synonymous  with  homosexuality.   A  colorful  artistic
representation of the term Joto is displayed in Figure 6.1.1.

Reclaiming and Redefining Jotería

While “joto” and “jota” have been used as a hurtful slur that impacts one’s sense of self, it has been reclaimed and resignified as a
term  of  empowerment  and  beauty  for  many.  This  reclaiming  as  a  “linguistic  subversion  may  create  new  worlds  in  the
present.”   Juan  Sebastian  Ferrada  argues  that  “through  the  reclaiming  of  jotería,  Latinx  communities  resignify  their  own  futures
into  existence.”   In  2021  The  Los  Angeles  Times  printed  the  word  jotería  in  a  positive  way  in  an  article  about  a  gay  bar  in
downtown Los Angeles that was struggling to survive during COVID.  Based on an interview I did with the journalist, she cited
my use of “jotería spaces” in talking about the importance of bars and clubs for jotería. This is a big deal because that word is not
used often in journalistic material. This also shows it can be reclaimed and redefined in popular media and not just in-group usage.
As the rest of this chapter shows, jotería has not only been reclaimed but has empowered many people to be their authentic selves
while doing work to uplift their communities and heal from past traumas attached to homophobia and transphobia. Scholars, artists,
and activists then have created a new discourse around what jotería means and what its liberatory praxis looks like. Ellie Hernandez
underscores that we “have to start creating discourses'' around these topics.

Two examples of artists reclaiming the word joto or jota are Chicana lesbian playwright and performer Monica Palacios and queer
Chicano poet and performer Yosimar Reyes. In 2015, Palacios wrote and performed along with two other artists Vanessa Terán and
Andrea  Vargas,  a  show  titled  “Jota  Love”  at  Highways  Performance  Space  in  Santa  Monica,  California.  The  performances
consisted  of  different  genres  including  comedy  and  dance  by  Latina/o  artists  in  Los  Angeles.  The  other  example  of  artists
reclaiming  the  world  joto  or  jota  are  queer  Chicano  poet  Yosimar  Reyes  and  artivist  (artist  +  activist)  Julio  Salgado,  who  in
collaboration  with  the  online  creative  expressions  organization  Dreamers Adrift  (co-founded  by  Salgado),  created  a  short  video
called “Behind the Image: Quiero Que Me Llames Joto” (I Want You to Call Me Joto), based on a poem by Reyes, which he recites

as Salgado illustrates. “I want you to call me joto,” he says in the poem, not as an insult or a joke but in a humanizing way.  As the
poem unfolds, and the poet resignifies (gives new meaning) the word joto, he confronts the pain the word has caused him but also
affirms that he has learned to love himself.  In the video, Reyes recites his poem, presumably written for a parent, there are scenes
of Salgado in the process of creating an illustration of Reyes, and scenes of Reyes writing the poem. By the end of the video, there
is  the  completed  drawing  of  the  poet,  arms  raised  high  with  the  words  “Quiero  que  me  llames  joto”  across  his  bare  body,  and
Reyes’ handwritten words from the poem on a bright pink background. Reyes’ face emanates pleasure and peace. The juxtaposition
of Salgado’s sketching and Reyes’ writing that lead to the finished product, the final illustration at the end of the poem, points to
the process of self-integration, self-love, and wholeness, which Reyes suggests is possible through the reclaiming of a word like
joto.

Over the years, the term jotería has developed multiple meanings. Many queer Chicanx and Latinx organizations, especially in the
southwest have used jota, joto and joteria as  empowering terms in their slogans or in posters they have used in protests, as you’ll
learn more about later in the chapter. On their website, the Association for Jotería Arts, Activism and Scholarship AJAAS, defines
jotería as a noun: “queer Latina/o, Chicana/o Indigenous people; a reclaimed term of empowerment.”  They also describe it as an
adjective: “relating to or supporting queer Latina/o, Chicana/o, and Indigenous people” and “a decolonial queer feminist sensibility
and politics, a mode of seeing, thinking, and feeling geared towards empowerment and social transformation.” In alignment with
the definitions put forward by AJAAS, communications scholar Robert M. Gutierrez-Perez defines jotería as “an identity category,
a cultural practice, and a social process.”  Luis M. Andrade argues that these definitions are an “interplay between individual and
group  processes  and  practices”  showing  “the  productivity  and  complexity  of  the  term.”   We  can  observe  these  meanings
manifested in the testimonios, or “jota-historias” of participants in José Manuel Santillan’s research on La Jotería, a Chicanx Latinx
queer student activist group at UCLA.
 Alex, one of the participants in his study said that he embraced the word jotería because he
saw himself as part of the community, “a community that I come from being queer, working class, Chicano, and [with] immigrant
parents. Like many other jotas y jotos, I know its not that easy to separate our identity from our queerness and our jotería.”  These
examples of what jotería means to student activists are called “jotería-historias.”  Jotería, albeit imperfect, is an inclusive term
that spoke to both their queer and Chicanx identities and also encompassed their gender and other parts of their identities. While
these  moments  of  reclamation  are  important,  Francisco  Galarte  reminds  us  that  joteria  studies  and  Chicanx  studies  must  be
inclusive of trans perspectives and that transgender as an identity and frame of analysis helps us think differently about rigid gender
binaries embedded in Chicana/o scholarship even in recent queer Chicana/o scholarship.

## 6.2: Genealogy of Jotería Studies

Intersectional Feminist, Queer, and Trans Genealogies

“Yes,  there  is  a  jotería  movement!  Although  it  hasn't  been  explicit,  Cherríe  and  Gloria  have  fought  for  it.  It  has  been  an
ongoing movement.” Lupe from UCLA student activist group La Joteria

Although  its  name,  jotería  studies,  is  relatively  new,  the  field  has  a  long  interconnected  genealogy.  The  trajectory  of  jotería
thinking,  writing,  performing,  and  engaging  in  activism  is  woven  together  like  a  carefully  crafted  braid  of  hair  or  like  sequined
fabric, sequins stitched together, creating a luminous tapestry.
 Jotería studies can be traced back to early work of ethnic studies
and  Chicanx  studies  and  gay,  lesbian,  gender  non-conforming,  and  trans  artists,  activists,  and  scholars  of  the  1960s,  1970s,  and
1980s, including Chicana feminists, third world (women of color) feminists, Chicana lesbian feminists, and trans feministas. (For
more on this, review Chapter 5).  Collectives  of  lesbian  and  queer  Chicanas  have  been  at  the  forefront  of  these  movements  and
shifts  in  consciousness.  Like  Gloria  Anzaldua,  Osa  Hidalgo  de  La  Riva  is  an  important  filmmaker  and  activist  who  laid  the
foundation for much of the creative and philosophical thinking. She is shown in Figure 6.2.1. When asked about her participation in
the Chicano movement, Hidalgo De La Riva says, “Well, we were all active, as a family. My brother Louis did Chicano murals and
he was always painting. When we organized events like a poetry reading or a Chicano art show, we would always have family and
a large mix of people.”  De La Riva’s comment reminds us that joteria were also part of the Chicano movement if those voices
have often been excluded from the historical record.

Figure 6.2.1: “Osa Hidalgo De La Riva” by Melissa Moreno, Flickr is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.

Jotería  studies  also  has  muxerista  foundations.  According  to  Anita  Tijerina  Revilla,  a  “muxerista  is  a  person  whose  identity  is
rooted  in  a  Chicana  Latina  feminist  version  for  social  change,  committed  to  ending  all  forms  of  oppression  including  but  not
limited  to  classism,  racism,  sexism,  homophobia,  and  citizen  ism.  Its  definition  is  rooted  in  the  scholarship  and  activism  of
Chicanos and feminists of color, but it's extended by the work experience and theoretical understandings of the members of Raza
 Anita Tijerina Revilla, Joanna Nuñez, José Manuel Santillana, and Sergio
Womyn,” an organization at UCLA in the late 1990s.
A. Gonzalez remind us of this concept and its history, expanding it and arguing for a jotería-muxerista approach, a radical queer,
gender expansive feminist perspective anchored in multidimensional and intersectional struggle, love, social justice, accountability,
friendship,  and  healing.
  The  historical,  theoretical,  and  spiritual  connections  to  women  of  color  feminisms  are  particularly
important to discuss in relation to the liberatory epistemologies that have shaped the critical work we do. Tracing the influence of
women  of  color  feminisms  on  queer  of  color  theories  and  jotería  studies  demonstrates  the  interconnectedness  of  the  diasporic,
transnational, hemispheric, decolonial, and antiracist frameworks central to jotería studies, this chapter, and this whole book, and to
the larger project of autonomy and self-determination for colonized peoples.

Jotería studies builds on the activism and writings of lesbian feminists of color such as the Combahee River Collective Statement,
This  Bridge  Called  My  Back:  Writing  by  Radical  Women  of  Color, Borderlands:  La  Frontera/The  New  Mestiza, Zami by  Audre
Lorde, and more.

In This Bridge Called My Back, edited by Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga, the collection of essays and poems were theories
in the flesh, meaning they were creating theories from their lived experiences.
 For example, Gloria Anzaldúa’s concept of “el
mundo zurdo” (left-handed world) referred to those of us on the margins, outside of the dominant world, because of our multiple
intersection  identities  such  as  queer  folks,  immigrants,  disabled,  and  others,  and  the  potential  among  us  to  create  solidarity  and
social change.
 For the Combahee River Collective, race was inseparable from gender. Emma Pérez developed the concept sitio y
lengua, which is about the empowerment of women, specifically Chicana lesbians, based on shared language and space, and how
this  bonding  and  nurturing  makes  it  possible  to  embark  upon  struggles  for  social  change.”   Chela  Sandoval’s  concept  of
differential consciousness is the shifting modes in thinking (and action),  involved in navigating systems of power, in turn leading
to action. These early contributions, concepts, and theories by feminist lesbians of color and the different namings of their identities
point  to  interconnectedness,  power  in  difference,  solidarity,  and  what  Anzaldúa  called  spiritual  activism,  and  have  been
instrumental to understanding the interconnected nature of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, and the idea that “the personal is
political,” which is central to jotería identity. See Chapter # 5: Feminisms for more details on this.

In his essay, “Queer Theory Revisited”  Micheal  Hames-García,  like  other  queer  scholars  of  color,  critiques  the  erasure  of  queer
 Hames-Garcia offers an alternative timeline that
people of color from writings on the development of the field of queer studies.
includes  lesbian,  gay,  and  queer  of  color  writers  such  as  Gloria  Anzaldúa,  James  Baldwin,  Audre  Lorde,  and  Cherríe  Moraga.
Theorizing  from  the  flesh,  jotería  studies  is  influenced  by  and  part  of  what  we  understand  as  queer  of  color  theories,  which
emerged as a response to the whiteness of queer theory, its tepid inclusion of race, and its overemphasis on high theory.

 Scholar Spotlight: Horacio N. Roque Ramírez

An award-winning scholar, archivist, and oral historian, Horacio N. Roque Ramírez, featured in Figure 6.2.2, was one of the
leading  scholars  in  queer  Latinx  studies  and  Central  American  studies  in  the  United  States.  He  was  an  immigrant  from  El
Salvador who received a Ph.D. in ethnic studies from UC Berkeley. His research focused on gay Latino San Francisco 1990s,
AIDS and HIV, queer oral history, queer migrations, and transgender Latina studies. His essays on Teresita la Campesina were
instrumental to current work on trans studies and jotería studies. For more on this, review Section 3.3: Embodied Memories:
Archival Movidas and Oral History. He was also an expert witness in political asylum cases for queer and trans folks. Ramírez
often  used  the  term  “centroMaricón”  to  refer  to  his  intersectional  identity  as  Central  American,  Salvadoran,  gay,  and
immigrant.

Ramírez  passed  away  on  December  25,  2015  from  complications  of  alcoholism.  His  legacy  lives  on  in  the  students  he
mentored at the University of California, Santa Barbara and elsewhere and in his research, which has heavily impacted what
we know today as jotería studies and trans Latinx studies. Memorials and tributes for him after his death remember him for
loving dancing and partying, for his sassiness, and for his commitment to queer Latina/o histories. Dr. Roque Ramirez warned
his graduate students of the dangers of not taking care of oneself in academia and recognized the damage it had done to him.
Unfortunately, the interconnected wounds he experienced in his life, took a toll on him. One of his collaborators, also a queer
feminist Central American oral historian, Nan Alamilla Boyd, wrote in a memorial to him: “He did this work from the heart
because  he  believed  that  people  on  the  margins—queers,  trans  immigrants,  and  people  of  color—have  important  stories  to
tell.”

NACCS Joto Caucus

As noted, the Association for Jotería Arts, Activism, and Scholarship (AJAAS),  came  out  of  NACCS.  In  the  early  1990s,  a  gay
men’s  group  within  the  National  Association  for  Chicana  and  Chicano  Studies  (NACCS)  named  themselves  the  Joto
Caucus.
 Raúl Coronado recounts that at his first NACCS in San Antonio, he called for a meeting of “Chicano jotos.” Initially
calling themselves NALGA, they changed it to the Joto Caucus officially in 1993. Coronado cites that he soon learned that not all

MEChAs (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) were as queer as the University of Texas, Austin MEChA. Move and cite
the homophobia of MECHas but how others have been intersectional such as the University of Nevada Las Vegas MEChA. The
Joto Caucus would play a pivotal part in AJAAS as described later in this chapter.

In  2007,  the  NACCS  Joto  Caucus  hosted  a  quinceañera  to  celebrate  fifteen  years  of  existence.  This  event  was  hosted  in
collaboration with ALLGO, an Austin-based queer people of color organization. To honor the intersectional feminist genealogies
discussed earlier in this chapter, especially Chicana lesbian feminists, the event organizers decided to honor Chicana lesbians as
madrinas as a form of expressing solidarity with them.

Association for Jotería Arts, Activism, and Scholarship (AJAAS)

Pinpointing the exact moment when a field of study started can be difficult, but often there is an event, a publication, or a debate
that is associated with its beginnings. In the case of jotería studies, the development in 2011 of the organization AJAAS, its first
conference  in  2012,  and  the  publication  of  the  2014  Joteria  Dossier  in  Aztlán:  A  Journal  of  Chicano  Studies  is  that  string  of
moments.  The  Association  for  Jotería  Arts,  Activism,  and  Scholarship  (AJAAS)  has  been  instrumental  in  the  development  of
jotería studies as a discipline and field of study. The conferences organized by AJAAS have brought together folks doing critical
work  in  the  classroom,  organizing  spaces,  and  in  the  arts  and  have  served  as  spaces  of  community  building  and  creative  and
scholarly partnerships, as well as spaces where friendships have started and romantic relationships have blossomed among jotería.
The conversations and experiences have nurtured scholarship in Chicanx studies and young scholars who are now faculty members
teaching  jotería  studies  courses  and  mentoring  a  new  generation  of  jotería.  There  have  been  many  challenges  along  the  way,
including  painful  moments  of  wounding  among  and  within  the  organization,  but  there  have  also  been  dedicated  moments  for
healing and reconciliation. This section focuses on the importance and critical role of AJAAS in the field providing a timeline of
the gestation of the organization to the present moment.

In  2011,  AJAAS  was  founded  by  queer  Chicanx  and  Latinx  artists,  activists,  and  scholars.  Members  of  the  Joto  Caucus  and
Lesbian Bi Mujeres Trans (LBMT) caucuses of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS) came together
because of a need for their own space feeling that while NACCS was an important space, they needed to expand and create their
own  organization.  They  had  also  grown  frustrated  with  moments  of  cisheteropatriarchy,  homophobia,  and  transphobia  in  the
organization  and  challenges  with  representation  within  the  organization.  Still,  as  part  of  NACCS,  the  Joto  and  LBMT  caucuses
organized conferences in Las Vegas (2007), Los Angeles (2008), and Oregon (2010) where many young queer and trans Chicanx
and Latinx folks were coming together for the first time seeing themselves reflected in a conference and feeling in community.

The 2008 conference in Los Angeles was held at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) organized by Adilia Torres,
Emmanuel Santillan and José Aguilar Hernandez. This conference brought jotería across different generations and hosted important
conversations  such  as  the  need  for  jotería  studies  curriculum  at  CSU.  Horacio  Roque  Ramirez,  Peter  Garcia  were  among  the
panelists talking about this topic. The keynote speaker was Cherríe Moraga and some of the panels were on fat shaming within the
Chicanx  Latinx  community,  jotería  activism,  and  more.  As  with  most  of  the  conferences  and  jotería  events,  many  of  the
participants who attended the conference felt empowered by the conversations they witnessed. One of the attendees was Zoraida
Ale Reyes ( at the time she went only by Ale), a trans Mexicana activist and student at University of California, Santa Barbara. In
an  email  Ale  sent  a  few  weeks  after  the  conference  to  a  group  of  people  (including  me)  whom  she  met  there,  she  wrote,
“Compañeros y compañeras. I’m glad I can write to people from across the U.S. and from North to South...I was deeply moved by
Cherrie Moraga's conversation[s]. Now, as we go back to our personal space, it’s good to work with our experiences and to share
them  just  [as]  I'm  doing.  Thank  you  for  becoming  part  of  the  sacred  space  that  grows  with  each  of  us  wherever  we  are.”   Al
Reyes’ message marks an important historical moment for joteria but also speaks to the importance of joteria being in community
with each other and of building a “sacred space” together as she emphasized in her email.

At  the  first  conference  at  University  of  Nevada,  Las  Vegas  (UNLV)  in  2007  youth  from  UNLV  MEChA  expressed  that  the
conference  felt  like  a  queer  version  of  the  Denver  Youth  Conference  of  1969.  This  was  a  groundbreaking  moment  for  jotería
studies  because  young  jotería  started  to  see  themselves  reflected  in  their  own  history.  After  these  successful  and  empowering
conferences  organized  by  the  caucus  still  under  NACCS,  and  after  many  conversations,  they  felt  it  was  time  to  form  their  own
organization. Activists, scholars, and artists met for several long meetings at University of California, Berkeley, the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, and University of California, Los Angeles, finally coming up with the name and structure for the organization,
although  not  without  contention  and  disagreements  about  what  the  organization  should  be.  Their  conferences  took  place  in
Albuquerque at the University of New Mexico in 2012, at Arizona State University and Pueblo in Phoenix in 2014, University of
Minneapolis and El Colegio Charter School in 2017, and Portland State University in 2019. The 2021 conference was supposed to

be held at University of Nevada, Reno but due to the COVID pandemic, instead AJAAS held a series of online symposia on Zoom
on activism and jotería scholarship.

The Jotería Studies Aztlán Dossier

aesthetics, and pedagogy and served as an entry into the field, providing room for others to continue to define and reimagine its
contours and themes. Garcia wrote, “The essays in the dossier are gestures toward elaborating this emergent formation, whatever it
might finally become.”

The dossier gave a name to this emerging field as it honored the work up to that point that had allowed for jotería studies to exist,
like women of color and lesbian feminists of color as described in the section earlier in this chapter. The editor’s introduction essay,
“Jotería Studies, or the Political is Personal” situates jotería studies in a genealogy of past scholarship, activism, and art by, about,
and among queer Chicanxs and Latinxs and also highlights the importance of the personal experiences and auto-historias as central
to jotería theorizing. Hames-Garcias shares that his jotería consciousness came not just from reading books or taking classes but
also from his romantic encounters and sexual experiences.

As  the  dossier  reminded  us,  many  writers,  scholars,  and  artists  across  different  fields  and  different  generations  within  Chicanx
studies  and  Latinx  studies  during  the  1990s-2000s,  whose  work  addressed  the  intersections  of  history,  colonialism,  Chicanidad,
Latinindad, and gender and sexuality, opened the path to talk about jotería as an identity, a politic, and a theoretical framework.
Among  these  writers  and  artists  are  Ana  Castillo,  Arturo  Islas,  Gil  Cuadros,  Carla  Trujillo,  and  scholars  like  Catriona  Rueda
Esquibel,  Horacio  N.  Roque  Ramírez,  Juana  María  Rodríguez,  Tomás  Almaguer,  Richard  T.  Rodríguez,  Sandra  K.  Soto,  David
Román,  Deborah  Vargas,  Larry  LaFountain  Stokes,  and  Carlos  Decena,  who  have  been  instrumental  in  developing  the  field  of
jotería  studies.
  Some  of  these  earlier  works  are  part  of  this  genealogy  but  don’t  necessarily  use  the  word  jotería  to  refer  to
themselves, or communities or theories they write about.

## 6.3: Jotería Activism Past and Present

Building on Previous Struggles

The activism discussed in the symposium in the previous section is part of a continuum of activism from the Chicana/o movement
to the present. AJAAS and other organizations have been possible due to the work of previous organizations such as Latino Lesbian
and Gay Organiåtion (LLEGO), Gay Latino Alliance (GALA), Gay and Lesbian Latinos Unidos (GLLU), La Jotería de UCLA, and
other  queer  and  trans  Chicanx  and  Latinx  organizations  from  the  1960s  to  the  present,  including  those  that  engaged  in  AIDS
activism. These are all part of the legacy of jotería activism and this section provides historical and contemporary examples.

First, jotería are in every movement from reproductive rights, to housing, to sex worker rights, to immigrant rights and transgender
rights,  to  recent  mobilizations  for  Black  Lives  Matter––jotería  are  doing  organizing  work  across  racial  lines  and  within  diverse
movements.  Art,  activism,  and  scholarship  have  always  been  interconnected.  While  people  are  writing  and  creating  art  and
theorizing  from  the  flesh,  on-the-ground  activism  has  also  utilized  a  jotería  approach:  unapologetic,  reclaiming  language,  and

by Jennicet Gutierrez, Jorge Gutierrez, Zoraida Reyes, and others in Santa Ana, California. This organization merged immigrant
rights with queer rights. Some of their programs have included Jotas vs ICE, an initiative to strategize, mobilize, and do campaign
work in 2020  and LGBTQ Border Project a 2019 collaboration with the Transgender Law Center, LA LGBT Center, San Diego
LGBT Center, Black LGBTQ+ Migrant Project, National Immigrant Justice Center, Arcoiris, Jardin and others, to support LGBTQ
asylum  seekers  with  humanitarian,  legal,  and  medical  support  and  build  long-term  advocacy  and  grassroots  organizing
infrastructure along the US-Mexico border.

The  immigrant  rights  marches  in  2006  were  in  response  to  HR  4437,  the  Sensenbrenner  Bill  which  criminalized  undocumented
immigrants. Immigrants and their allies took to the streets en masse in cities across the United States. In Los Angeles, the marches
which  took  place  on  March  25th  and  May  1st  were  among  the  largest  mass  demonstrations  ever  in  the  city.  Workers,  students,
families, activists, and members of immigrant rights and worker rights organizations marched in downtown Los Angeles to make
their  voices  heard.  Among  the  protestors  in  the  Los  Angeles  march  on  May  1st,  was  a  group  of  students  and  professors  from
CSUN. Some of these students were members of La Familia de CSUN. The group, carrying posters they had made the night before,
took the Red Line Metro train from North Hollywood to downtown. One of the protestors carried a sign that read “La Jotería Unida
Jamas Sera Vencida.”

 The idea of respectability politics, first coined by Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham as “politics of respectability,” has been used to
police  Black  women  and  Black  people  generally,  who  according  to  Jalina  Joseph  and  Roades  remain  hypervisible  and  under
surveillance. Through this lens Black folk have had to perform respectability at the expense of radical or transgressive practices.

## 6.4: Jotería Frameworks and Scholarly Conversations

Jotería Identity and Consciousness

Jotería studies encompasses various areas of study from a jotería lens. This section is a brief introduction
to the various modes of thinking, disciplinary offshoots, movements, and intersecting conversions within
the  broad  field  of  jotería  studies.  As  a  reminder,  none  of  these  are  in  an  academic  vacuum  as  they  are
interconnected  to  daily  responses  by  jotería  to  multiple  forms  of  dehumanization  in  the  streets,  in  our
homes, in our communities, and institutions. The concepts and ideas that spring forward are described
earlier as theories in the flesh that come from lived experiences. From jotería consciousness to health and
healing including spirituality, to higher education, to communications and sound studies, science, and the
environment, jotería has been imagining new ways to understand the world, writing about it, creating art,
and giving names to those processes. These are only a few examples of the way jotería consciousness has
impacted different fields of study and branches of thought. We encourage readers to do further research
to learn other areas where jotería is shifting ways of thinking.

Jotería is more than just a word. Jotería studies is more than just the study of queer and trans Chicanx and Latinx communities,
although that is part of it. It is a way of knowing––what we call an epistemology, a sensibility, a politic. When we say jotería there
is an implied notion of these radical tenets of social justice, not just about gender and sexuality, but rather an intersectional lens.
 According to the
Anita Revilla and Jose Manuel Santillana define jotería identity consciousness through eleven characteristics.
authors, jotería identity/consciousness:

1. Is rooted in fun laughter and radical queer love.
2. Is embedded in Mexican Latin American Indigenous ness and African diasporic past and present,
3. Is derived from the terms Jota and Joto and has been reclaimed as an identity consciousness of empowerment,
4. Is based on queer Latina/o Chicana/o and gender non-conforming realities or lived experiences,
5. Is committed to multidimensional social justice and activism,
6. Values gender and sexual fluidity and expressions,
7. Values the exploration of identities individually and collectively.
8. Rejects homophobia, heteronormativity, racism, patriarchy, xenophobia, gender discrimination, classism, colonization,

citizenism, and any other form of subordination,

9. Claims and is aligned with a feminist/muxerista pedagogy and praxis

10.  Claims and immigrant and working-class background/ origin
11.  Claims a queer Latina/o and Chicana/o ancestry, and
12. Supports community members and family and their efforts to avoid and heal from multi dimensional battle fatigue.

Jotería consciousness is a journey. Anita Tijerina Revilla and José Manuel Santillana’s essay on jotería consciousness was the first
to provide a working definition of what this consciousness might look and feel like. Other scholars have built on their essay, which
appeared in the Joteria Studies Dossier in 2014. For Tijerina Revilla

Sergio Gonzalez, building on Anita Revillas’s work, applied this to his research on students in higher education.

Jotería Health and Healing

As part of radical self-care, health and healing are important to jotería. Rooted in the intersectional perspectives discussed, health is
understood through antiracist, decolonial, holistic, and ancestral lenses. Given the racist history of the medical industrial complex,
eugenics movements, racist practices of sterilization, and the rampant homophobia of the inaction towards the AIDS crisis, jotería
imagined  alternative  community-based  ways  to  be  healthy  and  heal,  that  don’t  always  mean  resorting  to  mainstream  medicine.
Spirituality,  reclamation  of  our  bodies,  holistic  thinking  about  our  bodies  and  healing,  sex  positivity,  mental  health,  resisting
fatphobic narratives are all important aspect of joteria health and healing.  In the book Voices from the Ancestors Xicanx and Latinx
Spiritual  Expressions  and  Healing  Practices,  edited  by  Lara  Medina  and  Marta  Gonzales,  the  editors  assemble  a  collection  of
songs,  prayers,  poems  and  essays  that  speak  to  how  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  approach  healing  and  sacredness.  Several

examples in the book are by jotería and demonstrate specific ways that we use everyday practices to heal. From example, Berenice
Dimas, In my poem, “Un rezo pa’ los mariconxs,” I underscore the sacredness of our joteria communities, of my own body and the
sacredness found within my queerness.

Recognizing the spiritual, sacred, and ancestral within us is critical to jotería consciousness. While not everyone who identifies as
jotería  may  consider  themselves  spiritual,  this  holistic  thinking,  the  connection  behind  the  body-mind-spirit  matrix  is  central  to
jotería ways of knowing or epistemologies. Robert Gutierrez-Perez writes that “our spiritual practices as Jotería energy out of our
deep and personal investigations into the very bodies and locations we inhabit.

Reclaiming the Body

One way that this reclamation of the body has happened has been through art, for example, the art of Laura Aguilar. Like Aguilar,
whose  images  of  her  nude  body  have  inspired  many,  reconnecting  with  our  bodies  has  been  a  way  that  jotería  have  engaged  in
healing and reclamation of their bodies. After the culmination of the 2018 AJAAS Board Retreat in Reno, Nevada, members of the
executive board who attended in person planned a day at Lake Tahoe. They decided to hang out at a secluded part of the lake, a
cove, that was known for nude bathing. While some of the members were shy about it at first, eventually they eased into it and had
a great time. It was liberating to be in the water with people we loved and to rid ourselves of the stigmas placed on our bodies and
existence, to reconnect with nature. This was our way of reconnecting with nature, being in unison with the local outdoors near
Reno, and to be in community. Other organizations like Latino Outdoors and Wild Diversity aim to reclaim the outdoors for Latinx
and other people of color. One of the swim guides for Wild Diversity states, “we reflected on the ways that water has affected our
lives  and  our  ancestors’  lives.  Some  participants  spoke  of  how  colonization  has  disconnected  us  from  waterways  as  well  as  our
ancestors.”  These practices are part of healing journeys for jotería and other QTBIPOC but can also be considered to be part of
jotería environmentalists as described in the next section.

OJO:  Within  this  consciousness  sex-positivity  is  integral.  Sex-positive  approaches  allow  us  to  think  beyond  the  socially
constructed norms of what is considered normal, sinful, and appropriate behavior in terms of sexuality, masculinities, femininities,
and desire. In a general sense, sex-positivity is about “having positive attitudes about sex and feeling comfortable with one’s own
sexual identity and with the sexual behaviors of others.”  Jotería artists, activists, scholars, and practitioners work to decolonize
colonial,  heteronormative,  and  demonizing  views  on  sex  and  sexuality.  Sex  workers  have  taught  us  greatly  about  the  intricate
positions of power, sex, our bodies, and the need for bodily autonomy. Check out this episode on La Jotería Podcast for some fun,
sex-positive stories. Another podcast that talks about putería is Latinxperts, the official podcast of the Latino Studies Department at
the  University  of  Texas  at  Austin.  In  their  episode  on  the  changing  dynamic  of  language  and  specifically  on  expletives  or  bad
words,

Jotería Environmentalisms

Chicanx and Latinx folks have always been environmentalists even if they haven't always labeled themselves as such. The concerns
of the Chicano activists during El Movimiento had environmental dimensions from farmworker rights to land sovereignty. These
were depicted in the artwork of artists and writers Santa Barraza and Judy Baca. One example of Judy Baca’s work is the Great
Wall of Los Angeles, which is monument of cultural pride for Chicanx peoples. A portion of this wall is displayed in Figure 6.4.1.
The mural is on the wall of an empty concrete river. Above the mural are grass and trees and in the distance, fences and cars.

Figure 6.4.1: “Great Wall of Los Angeles” by BillyBobJoe20, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.

Similarly, writers like Cherríe Moraga, Helena María Viramontes, and Gloria Anzaldúa have incorporated environmental questions
in their writing. Many of these writers, however, do not associate with the mainstream environmental movement for its whiteness
and  elite  perspective  and  focus  on  beautiful  landscapes  or  outdoors  at  the  expense  of  people  and  other  organisms.  For  jotería,
environmental issues are part of the intersectional struggle. Emerging scholars such as Stephanie Martinez, José Manuel Santillana,
and Oscar Gutierrez are addressing these issues in their scholarship.

These  perspectives  fit  into  what  Maria DeGuzman  refers  to  as  "queer  trans  Latinx  environmentalisms,"  which  is  about  our
relationship to the environment and a lens that looks at intersectionality from a queer, trans Latinx perspective and the environment.
This  can  also  be  observed  in  cultural  production  such  as  zines.  Jotería  Cientifica  Zine,  for  example,  was  created  by  graduate
students Catalina Camacho and Chris Sandoval at the University of Texas A&M, as a way to fight back against racism in STEM
fields but also as a

stance  against  the  popular  conception  of  science  as  all-knowing,  objective,  or  ethical.  It  is  a  resistance  tool,  a  grassroots
space for a theory and praxis of indigenizing science and medicine. It is a loud rejection of the scientific “progress” narrative,
a  myth  that  extends  and  excuses  colonialism  to  oppress,  blame  and  control  us.  We  oppose  science’s  basis  in  colonial
violence, genocide, and disenfranchisement. And we call out the mass land theft and fundamental disrespect for Indigenous
sovereignty and culture, which so often manifests in scientific “research,” resource extraction, or so-called efficiency.

Jotería Pedagogies and Higher Education Interventions

Higher education and jotería studies scholarship has flourished in recent times. Journal articles and special issues, presentations,
panels, and social media conversations are addressing jotería studies recognizing the need to learn about jotería in their drive to be
more equitable and serve students better. For example, in 2021, I delivered an invited talk on jotería and higher education for the
American  Association  for  Hispanics  in  Higher  Education  (AAHEE).  In  2020,  José  Aguilar  Hernández,  one  of  the  founders  of
AJAAS, and Cindy Cruz edited a special issue on gender and sexuality in higher education in the Journal of Mexican American
Educators.  Many  of  the  papers  engaged  with  jotería  studies  in  particular.  This  shift  is  evident  in  the  work  by  Chicanx  graduate
students and early career scholars who are engaging with Jotería and publishing important work such as Roberto Orozco’s essay on
jotería  in  higher  education  and  epistemological  shifts,  Sergio  Gonzalez’s  research  on  jotería  consciousness  and  college  students,
and Omi Salas-SantaCruz’s writings on trans Chicanx folks and the concept of terquedad as a strategy of resistance.
 Terquedad
means  stubbornness  but  in  Salas-SantaCruz’s  version  of  terquedad,  inspired  by  her  childhood  memories  of  being  terca,  and  by
Anzaldua’s writing,  the stubbornness functions as a way to resist the violence of society’s imposition of binary gender ideologies.
Terqueded is a survival strategy and is composed of  “creative acts in accordance with the worlds we may inhabit.”

An important dialogue about joteria studies took place on social media, specifically on Twitter. Sergio Gonzalez, a member of the
board of AJAAS, organized a Twitter conversation on Jotería studies in partnership with The Samuel DeWitt Proctor Institute at
Rutgers University. This social media dialogue was fruitful and allowed folks to learn through this platform as well as engage in the
topic.  Another  example  of  young  scholars  expanding  the  conversation  in  Joteria  studies  is  Olga  Estrada,  a  doctoral  student  at
University  of  Texas,  El  Paso,  who  in  2022  presented  their  work  on  sucia  theory  and  reclaiming  joy  in  academia  at  National

Women’s Studies Association (NWSA) conference. Some of these publications and presentations are path-breaking because they
have initiated conversations, brought visibility to jotería or called in homophobia and transphobia, and the erasure of jotería within
higher education research.

Jotería Language, Communications, and Media

In his essay on shared authority, Horacio Roque Ramírez, writes, “What language do we use to remember things that, historically,
are outside language?  How do we put into words experiences that are so meaningful or so painful that they can’t be spoken?” He is
speaking  about  language  in  relation  to  memory  and  history.  Speaking  on  language,  Juan  Sebastian  Ferrada  has  written  about
linguistics and language from a jotería perspective. One outlet where language is experimented with is the media. Social media is
one  avenue  where  jotería  are  using  media  and  communication  to  share  ideas,  build  community,  and  create  change.  Robert
Gutierrez-Perez and Luis Manuel Andrade have made interventions into the field of Communication studies by introducing jotería
perspectives  in  the  realm  of  communication  studies.  In  his  book,  Joteria  Communication  Studies:  Narrating  Theories  of
Resistance,     Gutierrez-Perez  shares  that  jotería  approaches  to  communications,  like  storytelling,  chisme,  testimonios,  consejos,
 While in the past jotería activists
among others, function as alternative, “borderlands” communication modes forms of resistance.
like  Pedro  Zamora  used  his  time  on  the  Real  World  to  send  his  message  about  the  AIDS  epidemic  or  Chicanx  activists  using
newsletter or news media to send their message, social media has changed how messages and community building and activism
happens. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic many jota/o/xs used social media and virtual meeting platforms like Zoom to
bring  people  together  such  as  the  comedy  shows  curated  by  Cuban-American  lesbain  artist  Marga  Gomez,  conversations  of  La
Botanica Azul’s Adilia Elena Torres with healers on Facebook live, and the DJ Sizzle Cumbiatón on Instagram and Twitch events,
Maya  Chinchilla’s  event  with  Central  American  poets  and  artists,  and  more.  These  events  were  generative  and  brought  jotería
together despite the isolation caused by the pandemic.

## 6.5: Jotería Aesthetics and Cultural Production

Jotería Creative Expressions

Jotería cultural production (visual art, literature, film, social media) have been an integral part of the development of jotería studies.
Artists  and  cultural  producers  have  used  visual  and  literary  language  to  subvert  norms  and  resist  homophobic,  transphobic,  and
 According to William Calvo-Quiros, jotería cultural texts use a certain aesthetic
gender exclusionary narratives and iconography.
that  creates  “new  spaces  and  ruptures”  and  is  about  imagining  a  world  where  we  are  not  dehumanized  and  fully  embrace
difference.
  These  aesthetics,  rooted  in  the  Chicano  artistic  sensibility  called  rasquachismo,  are  composed  of  elements  that
represent  jotería  consciousness  in  a  visual,  sonic,  and  gestural  manner.  Calvo-Quiros  mentions  examples  like  drag  shows,
quinceañeras, altars, and more.

Jotería cultural texts or cultural production have created space to create the worlds Calvo-Quiros talks about. For example, Rita
Urquijo-Ruiz, in her essay in the Jotería Studies Dossier, mentions how when she went to see a play, “Men on the Verge of a His-
panic Breakdown,” by Guillermo Reyes at UC Riverside when she was an undergraduate student while she was still in process of
coming out as a lesbian. She laughed at all the queer jokes. pretending she didn't know what her friends were talking about. Later
they had a conversation and she was able to finally feel at home. This is an example of how a jotería cultural text, a play, could
open the space to feel seen and also create the space of vulnerability to open up to your friends.

Other  plays  include  Cherrie  Moraga’s  Giving  Up  the  Ghost,  Luis  Alfaro’s  one  man  show,  Monica  Palacios,  I  Kissed  Frida,  the
theater  works  of  VIVA.  Ellie  Hernandez  has  written  about  how  films  like  La Mission  (2009),  starring  Peruvian-American  actor
Benjamin Bratt, and Mosquita y Mari  (2013)  directed  by  queer  Chicana  Aurora  Guerrero,  are  examples  of  this.
  Most  recently
shows like Vida on FX, “Gentefied” on Netflix, and Los Spooky's on HBO are examples of jotería frameworks and or aesthetics
guiding  television  projects.  Performance  artists  Adelina  Anthonly,  the  collective  Tragic  Bitches,  the  Maricolectiva  are  all
performers or groups that deploy what Calvo calls a jotería aesthetic through their performances.

Jotería Sound Studies

Another area where jotería studies is in conversation is with sound studies. Sound studies is a field that, according to Joseph Salem,
studies the role of sound in culture. Through this lens we aim to understand and analyze what sound can tell us about history, the
environment,  politics,  urban  space,  more.  Scholars  of  color  and  jotería  studies  focus  on  how  sound,  gender,  race,  and  sexuality
work together. For example, Casillas looks at radio and immigrants, Alexa Vasquez looks at Cuban music, Jennifer Lynn Stoever
looks at the sonic color line. Deb Varags looks at the sounds of Texana music, Wanda Alarcon at how literature can be sonic, and
how  Chicana  literature  is  filled  with  sonic.  Eddy  Francisco  Alvarez  Jr.  builds  on  these  authors  and  the  work  of  jotería  studies
scholars  mentioned  here  to  develop  a  concept  called  jotería  listening  which  is  about  how  jotería  listen  collectively  and  what
 What are jotería sounds? For more on sound studies visit “Thinking Sounds,”
meaning they make of music, sounds, memories.
which provides an introduction to sound studies.

Future Directions

Growth  and  change  are  important  and  inevitable  in  any  academic  field  as  they  are  in  life.  As  we  have  discussed  here,  jotería
studies, although a relatively young field, stands on the legacy of ancestors who have shaped our thinking and fought hard for our
voices to be heard. The future of jotería studies is already being shaped by folks who are expanding the conversation to include
more  conversations  around  self  care,  pleasure,  hidden  archives,  and  transnational  perspectives.  More  and  more  jotería  studies  is
making its way into the curriculum in college classrooms. Francisco Galarte words about trans in joteria studies remain an ongoing
challenge.  As  more  trans  and  non-binary  voices  contribute  to  the  field  and  cisgender  folks  pay  attention,  as  we  listen,  the
emancipatory possibilities of the work of joteria studies becomes even more possible, and ensures no one is left behind as in past
movements.    This  book  you  are  reading  is  evidence  of  the  future  of  jotería  studies  in  relationship,  and  because  of,  Chicanx  and
Latinx studies and social movement activism, and art.

6.6: Conclusion

Summary

In  this  chapter,  you  learned  the  multiple  meanings  of  jotería  and  the  relationship  and  contributions  of  joteria  studies  to  Chicanx
studies and ethnic studies. You have learned the importance of self-naming through the genealogy of jotería studies by studying its
origins and impact on Chicanx activism, cultural production, performance, identity, and scholarship.

The chapter has demonstrated how jotería frameworks help to think critically about gender sexuality, race, and culture. Through the
testimonios of young people finding themselves in jotería studies, we can recognize the importance of jotería studies to present and
future studies on gender and sexuality within Chicanx studies. This chapter has covered the legacy of past Chicanx studies scholars
and women of color feminists who paved the way for jotería studies to exist. What do we gain from having a jotería studies lens?
This is an invitation for more work to fill in those gaps and more conversations within jotería studies.

Key Terms

Jotería  identity  and  consciousness:  a  way  of  thinking  and  being  based  on  a  journey  of  self-discovery  and  collective  healing,
guided by eleven tenets that include a commitment to multidimensional social justice, values gender fluidity and self-expression, is
rooted in laughter, fun and radical queer love.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 7: Social Movement Activity

 Learning Objectives

Explain and assess struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation among Chicanx and Latinx
communities.
Identify how historical and contemporary Chicanx and Latinx movements have enacted equity, self-determination,
liberation, decolonization, sovereignty, and anti-racism as analyzed.
Critically analyze the uses and application of intersectionality among Chicanx and Latinx communities, including
understanding movements that address class, gender, sexuality, national origin, immigration status, sovereignty, and
language.
Describe the importance of collective action to anti-racism and decolonial practices.

Introduction

In  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Studies,  activists,  scholars,  and  political  figures  have  worked  to  not  only  educate  communities  and
themselves,  but  to  affect  change  through  policy  advocacy  and  grassroots  resistance.  Social  movements  may  operate  in  different
ways depending on their context, goals, and supporters. However, they can be analyzed through common theoretical frameworks
for change, which identify groups and communities that coordinate sustained action to challenge (or defend) existing structures of
power  and  social  organization.  Three  frameworks  will  be  explored  in  this  chapter:  Chicana  movidas,  Chicanismo,  and  reform,
revolutionary, and reactionary movements. In Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x communities, struggles for justice and equity (“la lucha”)
may centrally focus on racial justice and decolonization, intersectional issues like gender justice and sexual liberation, or issues like
education and health. For more on these topics, visit Chapter # 8: Education and Activism and Chapter # 9: Health, respectively. This
chapter  demonstrates  the  strategies  and  tactics  used  by  Chicana/o/x  and  Latina/o/x  groups  to  advocate  for  political  change  and
mobilize social movements.

This spirit of resistance is shown in Figure 7.1, which depicts a striking worker created for the Yakima Valley Fruit Workers strike
in 2020.

## 7.1: Theoretical Frameworks

Concepts for Analyzing Chicanx and Latinx Social Movements

In order to effectively analyze social movements and political activity, we can use existing theoretical frameworks that have been
developed  by  Chicanx  and  Latinx  scholars  and  activists.  These  conceptual  frameworks  help  us  to  organize  the  key  patterns  and
differences  that  influence  how  and  when  people  mobilize  for  change,  and  how  successful  these  efforts  are.  Specifically,  in  this
section,  you  will  learn  the  definitions  of  Chicana  Movidas,  Chicanismo,  and  the  differences  between  reform,  revolutionary,  and
reactionary movements.

Chicana Movidas

Chicana  Movidas,  or  Movidas,  are  new  politicas  (politics)  “at  the  intersection  of  race,  class,  gender,  and  sexuality,  [that]
developed innovative concepts, tactics, and methodologies that in turn generated new theories, art forms, organizational spaces, and
strategies of alliance,” as well as policy change.  This includes aspects of social movement organizing that are typically considered
by  scholars  and  activists,  like  marches,  protests,  demonstrations,  advocacy,  lobbying,  and  labor  organizing.  It  also  emphasizes
creative and innovative strategies that build on cultural traditions, like teatro, storytelling, murals, altars, testimonios, filmmaking,
performance, and more. Chicana movidas highlight the role of drawing from cultural, familial, traditional, and spiritual strengths to
develop  collective  resources.  They  also  respond  to  the  patriarchal  biases  embedded  in  the  ideology  of  “Chicanismo,”  which
dominated some early mobilizations for Chicana/o/x liberation.

Chicanismo

Chicanismo  is  a  form  of  political  consciousness  calling  for  “Chicano  liberation”  that  was  widely  mobilized  in  the  1960s  in
response  to  “economic  inequality,  everyday  and  institutional  racism,  and  the  increasingly  militant  struggle  to  end  the  Vietnam
war.”  Chicanismo amplified the voices of Chicano men, in particular, as advocates for fairness and justice. This galvanized large
numbers of Mexican Americans, Latinas/os/xs, and supporters from other racial and ethnic groups to adopt a political identity as
Chicano or Chicana, and contributed to a larger project of racial justice, anti-war activism, and economic liberation. However, in
both implicit and explicit ways, Chicanismo often erased Chicanas, feminist concerns, and issues related to gender and sexuality.
While Chicanas were on the frontlines of these movements, they were often sidelined both within El Movimiento and by politicians
and the media. Using movidas, Chicana feminists name oppressions that are ignored, subordinated, or not perceived and identify
and  challenge  the  marginalization  of  their  communities  by  outlining  the  ways  in  which  gender,  race,  class,  and  sexuality  are
mutually constituted.

Reform, Revolutionary, and Reactionary Movements

Using the framework of Chicana movidas, we can examine social movements and advocacy in terms of the intersectional dynamics
that inform communities’ identities and relationships to structures of power. It is also helpful to analyze movements in terms of
both ideology and strategy.  Reform movements  seek  to  change  a  specific  policy,  either  at  the  organizational  or  political  level.
These movements work within existing structures to improve the distribution of resources or practices of a group. Revolutionary
movements transform society and bring about new ways of life. Advocates work to end policies that cause inequities and establish
systems that are organized around collective values. For example, the early 20th-century anarchist movement in southern California
worked  toward  transforming  social  institutions,  including  major  figures  like  Ricardo  Flores  Magón  and  his  brother  Enrique
Magón.  From a broader Latin American context, revolutionary movements include the Zapatista movements in Chiapas, Mexico
that  organized  for  self-determination  and  governance  over  their  lands.  A  mural  of  Zapatista  women  caring  for  their  children  is
shown  in  Figure  7.1.1.  As  well,  the  Purépecha  people  in  Michoacán,  Mexico  continue  their  revolutionary  resistance  against
oppressive  structures,  including  in  2011,  organizing  what  is  known  as  Cheran’s  levantamiento  (uprising)  against  Mexico’s
militarized  police  force.  Finally,  reactionary  movements  exist  to  oppose  and  counter  other  movements.  When  two  or  more
movements  persistently  work  against  each  other  over  time,  they  can  take  on  unique  dynamics  as  opposing  movements.  For
example, this is the case for anti-immigrant and immigrant justice movements.

Each of these three frameworks provides us tools for analyzing social movements and political activity. In the following sections of
this  chapter,  we  will  explore  specific  examples  and  campaigns  led  by  social  movement  activists,  using  these  conceptual
frameworks to guide and shape our analysis.

## 7.2: Chicanx and Latinx Civil Rights Activism

Roots of Contemporary Chicanx and Latinx Advocacy

Chicanx and Latinx communities have played an important role in the development of civil rights frameworks and policies in the
United States. While these contributions are often overlooked, Chicanx and Latinx advocates have helped to establish principles of
non-discrimination,  mount  legal  struggles  against  racist  policies,  and  mobilize  multiracial  coalitions  for  social  and  economic
justice.  This  work  has  been  carried  out  by  generations  of  activists  and  made  a  lasting  impact  on  U.S.  and  transnational  legal
structures.

For  example  in  1903,  Mexican  and  Japanese  farmworkers  formed  the  Japanese-Mexican  Labor  Association  (JMLA)  and  won  a
strike  against  the  agricultural  industry  in  Oxnard,  California.  The  farm  owners  typically  used  workers’  ethnic  or  cultural
backgrounds  to  encourage  mistrust  and  competition,  leading  to  lower  wages  and  poor  working  conditions.  The  JMLA  created  a
sense of unity and pride among Mexican workers in solidarity with Japanese communities. After tireless activism, including the
death of one protestor, this group won better pay and ended the subcontracting system that was exploiting workers. After winning
these victories, organizers of the JMLA attempted to join the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and continue as a labor union,
but  they  were  blocked  by  the  AFL  organizers,  who  said  that  members  of  Asian  origin  would  not  be  allowed  in  the  group.  The
JMLA organizers refused to accept this discriminatory policy and went on to continue their work and local organizing.

Juan Crow Racism

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical Violence. Please note that this section includes discussion of physical violence.

Throughout the early 20th Century, The United States was in an era of Jim Crow and Juan Crow Laws, which legally enforced
racist  segregation  policies  that  separated  facilities  and  services  for  white  people  and  excluded  communities  of  color.  Official
segregation  policies  were  matched  by  virulent  racism  and  violence.  The  simultaneous  dehumanization  of  both  Black  and  Latinx
communities can be seen in public signs that read, “No Dogs, No Negroes, No Mexicans,” as shown in Figure 7.2.1. One brutal
instance of coordinated white supremacist terrorism occurred in Los Angeles in 1943, in what historians call the Zoot Suit Riots.
During World War II, the deployment of massive numbers of working-age men into war created vacancies in the domestic labor
force. This contributed to a range of social changes, including the entry of people of color and white women into industries recently
dominated by white men. The deficit of labor in the agricultural industry also led the federal government to sponsor the Bracero
program  in  1942,  allowing  Mexican  citizens  to  work  in  the  U.S.  temporarily.  The  growing  Mexican  and  Mexican-American
community in places like Los Angeles caused anxiety for elites in power interested in maintaining the status quo racial hierarchy.
Media  accounts  used  exaggerated  and  misleading  language  to  spread  fear  and  produce  stereotypes  of  Black  and  Latino  men  as
violent criminals. Latinas and Black women were also targeted for policing, although the stereotypes constructed threat primarily
through hypersexualization.

 Historical Spotlight: Analyzing the Zoot Suit Riots

The Zoot Suit Riots were an example of communities coming together to defend themselves and fight back against racism and
violence affecting Latinx communities. This event responded to the pervasive violence that characterized the Jim Crow era,
and it is an important backdrop for understanding the development of civil rights and legal advocacy strategies among Chicanx
and  Latinx  communities.  While  reform  strategies  gained  a  lot  of  attention  in  the  1940s  and  1950s,  this  was  not  the  only
approach to advocacy.

Zoot suits are outfits characterized by oversized wool coats that were popular among Black, Latino, and Filipino communities
and inspired by the styles worn in Harlem, New York. The use of extra wool fabric to create large, baggy outfits was a symbol
of status and prosperity, especially given the strain on fabric supplies during the war. Pachucos were especially known for their
zoot suits and jazz music. In Figure 7.2.2, the image shows a group of young Mexican American boys who were rounded up
and detained simply because of their zoot suit style. In Figure 7.2.3, the image shows a positive depiction and celebration of
the zoot suit style as part of a stage performance in Mexico in 2010.

In 1943 in Los Angeles, white American sailors claimed that they were taunted by Pachucos, and proceeded to take cabs across
town to East Los Angeles, a predominantly Mexican-American area, and start attacking any Latino wearing a zoot suit on the
street. When the police arrived, they arrested the victims of these crimes rather than the assailants. Media spread word about
these racist attacks, often mirroring the same beliefs as the police officers and blaming the folx wearing zoot suits for being
attacked.  On  June  3,  1943,  50  servicemembers  from  the  U.S.  Navy  marched  through  the  streets  of  Los  Angeles  with  clubs,
beating Latinos wearing zoot suits or similar clothing.

Thousands more white military service members, off-duty police officers, and civilians were emboldened to violence over the
following  days.  They  beat  and  publicly  stripped  men  wearing  zoot  suits,  attacked  and  cut  the  hair  of  those  with  non-white
hairstyles,  like  a  ducktail,  and  rampaged  throughout  the  city,  unleashing  violence  on  communities  of  color.  The  spread  of
violence can be attributed to the widespread racist ideologies of the assailants as well as the cultural and institutional response.
Media  messages  reinforced  racialized  narratives,  while  law  enforcement  openly  sanctioned  the  attacks,  and  the  city
government  failed  to  intervene  effectively.  Eventually,  all  service  members  were  banned  from  Los  Angeles  and  the  military
police were brought in to stop the violence.

Retaliation by white supremacist groups is a common theme in the United States, and we can see examples of this today. For
instance,  in  recent  years,  we  have  seen  a  rise  in  violent,  mass  shootings  that  target  communities  of  color.  In  2015,  a  white
supremacist assailant traveled to a Charleston Church and murdered nine people. His statements online prior to the shooting,
confession  to  the  police,  and  statements  after  being  tried  and  prosecuted  all  indicated  that  he  was  motivated  by  a  racist
ideology and felt no remorse for his actions. Similar to the attacks on people wearing zoot suits, the killer traveled away from
his residence to encroach on a community of color’s space with the explicit goal of inciting violence and harm.

In 2019, another violent assailant in El Paso, Texas attacked nearly 50 people, killing 23, and then publicly stated to the police
that he was motivated by a desire to kill as many Mexicans as possible. In 2022, different white supremacists killed ten people
in a mass shooting targeting Black people at a grocery store in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York and 21 people,
including  19  children,  at  an  elementary  school  in  Uvalde,  Texas.  Unfortunately,  these  are  just  a  few  of  many  examples  of
racially motivated violence against communities of color in the United States. For a more holistic picture of the status of hate
crimes and violent extremist groups in the United States, you can explore the Statista website linked here.

The experience of violence across different groups has also inspired solidarity among the people taking action to end racism and
white supremacy. For example, in Figure 7.2.4, there is a poster that reads, “Raza en Defensa de Las Vidas Negras” (“La Raza in
Defense of Black Lives”) with two Latinas protesting for Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Black Lives Matter.

Civil Rights and Legal Advocacy

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical Violence. Please note that this section includes discussion of physical violence.

The  League  of  United  Latin  American  Citizens  (LULAC)  was  a  frontrunner  in  the  struggle  for  civil  rights,  as  it  was  formed  in
1929. This group advocates for civil rights and has helped contribute to social, policy, and legal change. For example, members
were  involved  in  Hernandez  v.  Texas,  which  dealt  with  the  exclusion  of  Mexican-American  people  from  jury  service.  The
Hernandez case began because an all-white jury convicted Pete Hernandez of the murder of Joe Espinoza. Hernandez’s attorney
sought to invalidate this verdict on the basis of the jury, as Mexican Americans were formally excluded from jury service. A lower
court denied Hernandez’s case and claimed that people of Mexican origin are not included in the “equal protection” clause of the
14th Amendment of the Constitution because the Census legally classifies Mexican Americans as white. In its unanimous decision,
the Supreme Court affirmed in 1954 that equal protection does in fact apply to Mexican-origin people, as well as multiple racial
groups who have experienced historical marginalization and systemic oppression. This is just one of the many struggles that took
place to dismantle racist legal structures affecting Chicanxs, Latinxs, and other people of color in the United States. In Section 8.2:
The  Struggle  for  Equality,  1900-1954,  you  will  learn  more  about  the  1947  Mendez  v.  Westminster  case  which  was  a  landmark
decision for desegregation in public schools and paved the way for the Brown v. Board of Education decision at the federal level.

Figure 7.2.5: “Queremos nuestras escuelas abiertas y seguras" by Estefanía Rivera, Justseeds is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Even as the legal structures of racial segregation began to falter, Latinx communities still experienced exclusion and discrimination
in all arenas of life. In Figure 7.2.5, there is a poster that reads, “Queremos Nuestras Escuelas Abiertas y Seguras” (We want our
schools to be open, secure, and safe.”) Public schools were failing Chicanx and Latinx communities. Students were receiving sub-
par educational preparation, resulting in the lowest reading rates and graduation rates of any racial or ethnic group. Teachers did not
represent  their  community  and  the  curriculum  rarely  incorporated  any  culturally  or  historically  relevant  content.  Students  were
being pushed out of school and tracked into vocational career pathways, meaning that not many Chicanx and Latinx folx had the
opportunity to attend college. This also contributed to Chicano and Latino men being drafted in disparate numbers for the Vietnam
War.  Local  police  were  constantly  surveilling  and  profiling  Mexican-origin  and  Latinx  communities.  Negative  stereotypes  of
Chicano  and  Latino  males  as  gang  members  and  drug  dealers  created  stigma  in  their  daily  lives  and  have  long-term  negative
implications. American labor markets restricted opportunities to well-paid jobs and representation in unions, forcing Chicanx and
Latinx  people  into  underpaid  employment  with  poor  working  conditions.  In  the  1960s,  the  growing  momentum  of  civil  rights
advocacy,  along  with  opposition  to  the  Vietnam  War,  the  growing  agricultural  labor  economy,  and  federal  Native  American
relocation policies contributed to the collective feelings of unrest and resistance.

Identity Politics and Chicanismo

In  Section  2.1:  Defining  Latinx  Demographics,  you  learned  about  the  various  labels  and  identities  associated  with  Chicanas,
Chicanxs, Chicanos, and Latinas, Latinos, and Latinxs. In the context of social movements, Chicana/o/x identities began to emerge
in the 1960s, led by Mexican-origin communities in response to the gains of Mexican American groups, as well as critiques of the
integrationist  and  assimilationist  perspectives  in  the  reform-focused  advocacy  of  the  1940s  and  1950s.  Access  to  mainstream
institutions did not yield the gains promised by previous generations.

The  term  Chicano  emerged  to  cultivate  a  sense  of  cultural  and  ethnic  pride  and  mobilize  community  members  to  commit  to
revolutionary change and re-organizing societal institutions around inclusion and justice. The Chicano movement originated as a
set of diverse local and regional struggles for social justice, civil rights, and political representation throughout the U.S. Southwest
and  Midwest.  Activists,  men  and  women,  young  and  old,  demanded  equal  rights  under  the  law,  an  overhaul  of  the  educational
system, access to decent housing, community-run healthcare, and an end to police brutality and the Vietnam War. There was no
singular origin point of the movement, and scholars still debate the histories of how the Chicano identity formed and spread among
multiple groups. However, most agree that the late 1960s and early 1970s, especially 1969-1973, were characterized by a surge of
Chicano activism and high rates of mobilization throughout the U.S. While local groups often had specific, tangible goals that they
were working to achieve, the shared mission uniting these efforts was “to construct a new political subject for the world stage—the

Chicano—who  sought  to  transform  his  subjugation  as  an  ethnic  Mexican  living  in  the  United  States  into  a  persona  much  more
powerful and respected in daily life.”

A simplistic definition of Chicano / Chicana / Chicanx is that these are simply a replacement for the term Mexican-American. For
example, Oxford Learner’s Dictionary defines Chicano as “a person living in the US whose family came from Mexico.” From this
point of view, Chicano can be derived from “Mexicano.” By removing the “Me” at the beginning, the word shortens to “Xicano.”
In Spanish, the X is pronounced like “Ch” in English, so the term becomes “Chicano,” and Chicana and Chicanx then form the
feminine and gender-neutral versions of the word. While the term is sometimes used this way, the simplistic definition hides the
more complex history and political significance of the word as a collective identity-based in social movement advocacy, which you
first learned about in Chapter # 2: Identities.

First  and  foremost,  the  term  Chicano  was  used  first  as  a  derogatory  term  against  Mexican  American  communities,  and  activists
reclaimed the term to give it a positive meaning associated with self-determination. Some groups retain the X at the beginning of
the word: Xicano, Xicana, and Xicanx, in part to signal this association. By using the X, groups intentionally amplify the Spanish
spelling of the word, affirming the cultural identities of bilingual communities as valid and valuable members of our cultures and
societies on their own terms, rather than within the boundaries and expectations of the Anglo, English-speaking dominant group.
This mirrors some of the policy demands of grassroots movement organizing, including protections against discrimination based on
language use, and access to bilingual services and materials.

As  Ana  Castillo  asserted  in  1994,  Xicana/o/x  is  “a  political  identity  that  emphasizes  decolonization,  rejection  of  cultural
convention,  and  activism  over  origin  or  language.”   In  particular,  by  emphasizing  “activism  over  origin  or  language”  this
recognizes  that  Xicanas,  Xicanos,  and  Xicanxs  may  or  may  not  speak  Spanish,  and  may  or  may  or  may  not  have  direct  family
lineage  to  Mexico  or  Latin  America.  In  this  sense,  one  is  Xicana/o/x  as  a  direct  correlation  to  their  ongoing  contributions  to
activism for equity and justice for La Raza (all people of Latinx descent and their families).

The broad identity created by Chicano activists was able to bring together large groups to accomplish a shared goal. It also meant
that the label can mean different things to different people, including contradictory perspectives on social movement tactics and
strategies. For instance, some Chicanxs emphasized taking pride in their cultural roots and Indigenous heritage, while others sought
to  enact  political  revolution  and  create  an  autonomous  nation-state.  However,  many  Chicanos  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  were
disconnected from Mexican lands, cultures, languages, and traditions by decades of immigration policy and because there were no
educational opportunities in the school systems to learn about their own heritage. For more on the relationships between Latinxs
and Indigeneity, you can review Chapter # 4: Indigeneities.

Students Lead the Way: El Movimiento

A major influence on Chicanxs mobilizing in California took place on March 5, 1968, when 22,000 students walked out of their
classes  at  Garfield,  Roosevelt,  Lincoln,  Belmont,  and  Wilson  High  Schools  in  East  Los  Angeles.  Also  known  as  the  East  L.A.
Blowouts, this demonstration brought attention to 26 demands, including changes in academics, administration, and facilities, as
well  as  recognition  of  students’  rights  and  humanity.  Students’  peaceful  protests  were  met  with  police  violence,  and  they  were
arrested  and  locked  behind  gates.  The  Board  refused  the  students’  demands,  and  the  police  held  a  local  teacher,  Sal  Castro,  on
charges of conspiring to disturb the peace for months. After round-the-clock protests at the School Board Office, Mr. Castro was
released. However, the schools continued to resist structural changes, and activists became entrenched in a decades-long struggle to
reform  and  transform  L.A.  schools.  In  Chapter  8:  Education  and  Activism,  you  can  go  more  in-depth  into  Chicanx  and  Latinx
experiences in education and the formation of Chicanx and Latinx Studies fields.

Students and activists were also inspired by El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán during the 1969 Chicano Youth Conference hosted by
Rodolfo  “Corky”  Gonzalez  in  Denver,  Colorado.  This  document  focused  on  translating  the  spirit  of  protest  into  organizational
principles that can sustain action over time. The seven goals laid out in the plan pertain to unity, economy, education, institutions,
self-defense,  cultural  values,  and  political  liberation.  The  1,500  young  people  at  this  conference  shared  these  ideas  with  their
communities and continued to mobilize toward specific action items and policy goals. The term Chicanismo was born at this event,
and it emphasized the need to come together as Chicanos to make unified claims for racial liberation.

One major issue affecting the Chicanx community, especially Chicano men, was the disparate rate of being drafted into dangerous
military service to wage war in Vietnam. The National Chicano Moratorium Committee Against the Vietnam War (or simply, The
Chicano Moratorium) was a movement of anti-war activists. These efforts emphasized resistance to the war effort, both because
the costly war was depleting resources needed to deal with social and economic issues facing communities living in the U.S. and
because Mexican-Americans made up 20% of all casualties in the war, when they only accounted for 10% of the U.S. population at

the  time.  In  1970,  the  group  mobilized  a  demonstration  of  30,000  people  in  East  Los  Angeles,  which  was  the  largest  anti-war
protest organized by any single ethnic group in the United States. News coverage of the Chicano Moratorium, including images of
the protestors is shown in Figure 7.2.6.

 Activist Spotlight: Corky Gonzalez

Rodolfo  “Corky”  Gonzales  was  born  on  June  18,  1928.  He  was  a  boxer,  writer,  and  Chicano  activist.  He  worked  on  voter
registration  for  John  F.  Kennedy’s  presidential  campaign  and  successfully  registered  more  Mexican  Americans  than  at  any
other  time  in  Colorado’s  history.  Gonzales  founded  Crusade  for  Justice  in  1967,  which  was  a  militant  organization  of  high
school and college students who sought to increase educational opportunities and equity for Latinx students. He inspired the
Chicano movement with his organizing and the poem, “I am Joaquín.” You can read the poem in English and Spanish on the
Chicano History and Culture website linked here. A photo of Corky is shown in Figure 7.2.7.

## 7.3: Queer and Feminist Chicanx Movements

Confronting Patriarchy and Heterosexism in Chicanismo

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical and Sexual Violence. Please note that this section includes discussion of physical and sexual violence.

Chicano  identity  and  Chicanismo  have  a  history  of  hyper-masculinity,  sexism,  and  homophobia.  These  dynamics  have  been
systematically challenged, and some of the success can be seen in the names of academic and activist groups that reflect greater
gender inclusion, such as “Chicana and Chicano Studies” or “Chican@ Studies” and “Chicanx Studies.” Beyond naming, however,
the structures of patriarchy and heterosexism influence movement organizations, protests, and advocacy campaigns. Men leaders
often called for unity on behalf of Chicanos or La Raza, while prioritizing issues that centrally concerned men, like the draft, job
discrimination, access to political power, entry into educational institutions, and community autonomy.

While  these  issues  also  affect  women,  other  concerns  like  birth  control,  ending  forced  sterilization,  welfare  rights,  protecting
against domestic violence, and women’s sexual liberation were ignored or actively resisted by organizational leadership. “La Nueva
Chicana”  (The  New  Chicana  Woman)  was  determined  to  bring  these  concerns  together  and  simultaneously  address  systems  of
subordination based on both race and gender. In Figure 7.3.1, an artist has rendered a group of women marching to two drums, with
their reflection showing beneath, over the words “La Memoria es Feminista" (Memory is feminist). Text on the image reads, “La
Memoria es Feminista” (Memory is feminist) and one of the reflections is holding a sign that says, “Dónde están nuestros hijos”
(Where are our children). This message connects current struggles for gender equality to previous ones, and also reminds us that
feminism  has  a  long  history.  Feminism  creates  new  opportunities  for  women,  and  it  also  builds  on  Indigenous  traditions  that
include matriarchal systems and other traditional ways of maintaining gender equality.

Chicana  feminisms  engage  in  political  struggles  for  liberation  and  create  knowledges  that  build  coalitions  across  difference  to
mobilize  consciousness  and  transform  systems.  Chicana  writers  and  feminists  reinterpreted  the  world  for  Chicanas  to  draw
connections  and  develop  their  identities  in  a  society  that  devalues  women,  especially  women  of  color.  This  draws  on  distinct
solidarities  with  Chicano  men,  Indigenous  peoples,  people  of  color,  white  women,  and  gender  non-binary  people.  For  instance,
white feminism provides tools to discuss and analyze sexual violence and sexual pleasure, topics that are often silenced. However,
Chicana experiences have to be understood and interpreted from their own intersectional standpoint. Chicanas have written about

and amplified their experiences in “Chicana- and Chicano-generated newspapers, journals, and, later, anthologies, such as Aztlán,
El Grito del Norte, Encuentro Feminil, and Regeneración.”

Opposing Movement Dynamics among Chicana Women

Not all Chicanas agreed with Chicana feminists’ view that achieving gender justice was an important part of Chicanx communities’
liberation  from  white  supremacy.  Chicana  “loyalists”  were  women  in  the  Chicano  movement  that  believed  their  place  was  to
support  Chicano  men  in  their  struggle  against  racialized  oppression,  not  women’s  liberation.  The  women  often  joined  men  in
ridiculing women who sought positions of power, calling them terms like malinchistas (race traitors), and marimachas (lesbians).
Leaders tried to dissuade women from voicing feminist concerns by framing the struggle as “Chicano primero,” (Chicano identity
first) pitting their movement for cultural and racial heritage (“la causa”) against calls for women’s liberation.

When  nearly  600  Chicana  activists  gathered  in  Houston  on  May  28-30,  1971  for  the  first  National  Chicana  conference,  La
Conferencia de Mujeres Por La Raza, “loyalist” women walked out of the conference in protest over differences in political identity
and  goals.  Ultimately,  this  confrontation  elevated  discussion  about  women’s  issues  and  inspired  Chicana  activists  to  critique
patriarchy  and  homophobia.  This  led  to  the  formation  of  new  organizations  and  campaigns.  Adelaida  del  Castillo  and  Anna
NietoGómez founded and edited the journal Encuentro Feminil at California State University, Long Beach. This became one hub of
knowledge that centers the voices and perspectives of Chicana scholars and researchers. For a more in-depth exploration of these
topics, visit Chapter # 5: Feminisms.

Advocating  for  change  requires  sacrifice  and  collective  support  and  incurs  costs  for  those  involved.  Organizational  structures
within  social  movements  help  to  fortify  activists,  recruit  new  members,  train  emergent  leaders,  and  generate  resources  for
mobilization.  In  particular,  Chicanas  and  Latinas  have  led  efforts  to  form  and  grow  organizations  and  link  social  movement
advocacy  to  existing  kinship  networks,  family  structures,  and  friend  groups  that  nurture  and  sustain  advocacy.  For  example,  in
1970, the Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional (CFMN, National Mexican Women’s Coalition) was formed to address the needs
of  Chicanas  and  the  issues  facing  women,  children,  families,  and  communities  that  had  gone  overlooked.  This  group  was
determined to provide women with the social and political capital necessary to produce social change. This led to the formation of
the Chicana Service Action Center (CSAC) in 1972, as well as the Centro de Niños and League of Mexican American Women,
both  in  1973.  These  groups  reflect  the  wide  breadth  of  activity  included  under  calls  for  “Chicana  Power,”  a  rallying  cry  that’s
shown in Figure 7.3.2.

 Activist Spotlight: Francisca Flores

Francisca Flores is a key figure for understanding Chicanx activism. She supported and inspired Chicana feminist organizers to
create organizations that focused on the intersection of race and gender. Her work helped to create new opportunities for the
recognition and celebration of women’s voices. This commitment to collective effort helped mobilize Chicanas and Latinas to
develop leadership consciousness and fend off the barriers created by patriarchy and sexism.

She  was  involved  at  all  levels  of  civil  rights  work.  As  an  activist  in  the  California  Independent  Progressive  Party  and  the
National Progressive Party, she amplified the experiences and perspectives of Chicanas in social and economic policy debates.
She was also a member of Mexican American civil rights organizations such as the Sleepy Lagoon Barrio Defense Committee
in 1942; Asociación Nacional México Americana, founded in 1949; the Community Service Organization (CSO), formed in
1947; and the Mexican American Political Association (MAPA), created in 1960. Seeing that women leaders were often central
to  the  functioning  and  success  of  these  groups,  she  brought  together  other  Chicanas  and  Latinas  and  they  established  many
organizations focused on women.

Queer Latinxs Resisting Oppression

Rampant homophobia in both Chicano and Chicana activism creates a unique experience of isolation and exclusion for queer folxs,
especially  Chicanas.  Queer  Chicanas  engaged  in  women’s  liberation  and  queer  activist  spaces  to  build  solidarities  across  racial
lines and build community around an analysis of gender and sexuality. This included developing allies within queer communities to
advance  intersectional  justice.  Despite  white,  middle-class  domination  of  these  spaces,  their  experiences  inspired  intersectional
mobilization and solidarity with Black queer women and other queer POC communities. Connecting with diverse queer people of
color allows queer Chicanxs to work in solidarity, rather than in isolation. Queer scholars and leaders in particular used poetry and
writing to influence and transform heteronormative Chicana and Chicano movements.

Gloria E. Anzaldúa was a queer Chicana poet, writer, and feminist theorist. Her poems and essays explore the anger and isolation
of  occupying  the  margins  of  culture  and  collective  identity.  For  example,  this  quote  from  Borderlands  shows  her  poetic
interpretation of the collective identities of mexicanos:

Nosotros los Chicanos straddle the borderlands. On one side of us, we are constantly exposed to the Spanish of the Mexicans,
on  the  other  side  we  hear  the  Anglos'  incessant  clamoring  so  that  we  forget  our  language.  Among  ourselves  we  don't  say
nosotros los americanos, o nosotros los españoles, o nosotros los hispanos. We say nosotros los mexicanos (by mexicanos we
do not mean citizens of Mexico; we do not mean a national identity, but a racial one). We distinguish between mexicanos del
otro  lado  and  mexicanos  de  este  lado.  Deep  in  our  hearts  we  believe  that  being  Mexican  has  nothing  to  do  with  which
country one lives in. Being Mexican is a state of soul not one of mind, not one of citizenship. Neither eagle nor serpent, but
both. And like the ocean, neither animal respects borders.

While  her  perspective  was  rooted  in  an  inclusive  queer  Chicana  sensibility,  the  wisdom  of  her  words  extended  far  beyond  this
specific experience. Anzaldúa has been awarded the Lambda Lesbian Small Book Press Award, a Sappho Award of Distinction,
and  an  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts  Fiction  Award,  among  others.  Borderlands/La  Frontera:  The  New  Mestiza  by  Gloria
Anzaldúa emphasized indigeneity and mestiza identities. Similarly, This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of
Color,  edited  by  Cherríe  Moraga  and  Gloria  Anzaldúa  “critiqued  sexism,  racism,  classism,  and  homophobia  in  communities  of
color and in the larger society.”  A picture of Anzaldua is shown in Figure 7.3.3.

Figure 7.3.3: “Gloria Anzaldua" by K. Kendall, Flickr is licensed CC BY 2.0.

While  early  calls  for  Chicano  liberation  operated  from  a  narrow  view  of  patriarchal  nationalism,  Chicanas  and  Chicanxs  have
challenged and transformed this project. Chicana/o/x Power is a movement and political identity that emphasizes decolonization,
rejection  of  cultural  convention,  and  activism  over  origin  or  language.  There  is  no  one  right  way  to  achieve  liberation,  but
communities can work in solidarity and through organized movements to bring about justice.

Today’s  movements  have  been  deeply  informed  by  the  alliances  and  bridges  formed  by  these  forward-thinking  activists.  For
example, the undocumented immigrant youth movement “borrowed” the cultural schema of “coming out” and joined it with “out of
the  shadows”  for  successful  mobilization.  Undocumented  queer  leaders  were  key  in  amplifying  this  framing  and  forging  the
connection between the different experiences of being socially constrained by the heteronormative expectations of “the closet” and
the  structural  violence  that  places  undocumented  children  in  fear  of  having  their  immigration  status  used  against  them  or  their
families. You can explore more topics related to queer and trans experiences and activsm in Chapter # 6: Jotería Studies.

## 7.4: Labor, Farmworker, and Immigrant Movements

The United Farm Workers

Dolores Huerta co-founded the United Farm Workers (UFW) with Cesar Chavez in order to organize for labor rights and win
recognition of poor working conditions and pay. The UFW was successful because it incorporated cultural strategies to mobilize
immigrant and Indigenous communities. Huerta’s leadership was especially instrumental, although she was often overlooked when
compared to Chavez. Despite this, her leadership was vital to the movement and mobilized 17 million people to boycott grapes in
solidarity with farm workers. She is also credited with popularizing the phrase “¡Si se puede!” (Yes we can!), which was also a
rallying cry during the Obama presidential campaign and continues to be used in social movement advocacy today. She continues
to have an impact through the Dolores Huerta Foundation and was recognized by President Barack Obama with the Presidential
Medal of Freedom in 2011 for her contributions to social and economic justice.

Working  on  behalf  of  communities  that  have  been  socially  and  economically  exploited  regularly  brings  Chicanx  and  Latinx
  In  California  especially,  struggles  for  worker
movements  into  solidarity  with  other  ethnic  groups  and  immigrant  communities.
justice  have  often  been  conducted  in  larger  coalitions,  including  Asian  Americans,  Black  communities,  and  Indigenous  peoples.
Immigrants have been a consistent part of the agricultural labor force, with employers exploiting the communities’ precarious legal
and  economic  status  by  providing  poor  working  conditions  and  low  wages.  While  employers  benefit  from  encouraging  racial
animosity  between  groups,  social  movements  have  used  cross-ethnic  solidarity  to  inspire  successful  collective  mobilization.  For
instance, the UFW built from the successful mobilization in Filipinx communities, with leaders like Larry Itliong coming together
with Latinx communities and migrants.

Labor and Farmworker Movements Today

While  the  UFW  continues  to  operate  today,  it  has  become  a  centerpiece  within  a  much  broader  movement  for  farmworkers  and
labor  rights  in  agricultural  industries.  For  example,  the  Coalition  of  Immokalee  Workers  sponsors  campaigns  for  fair  food
industries,  as  well  as  against  slavery  within  the  agriculture  industry,  especially  in  the  southeastern  United  States.  In  California,
Santa Maria farmworkers organized a month-long campaign in 2021 to have local berry farms raise the wage for farmworkers who
harvest strawberries. After collecting over 60,000 signatures nationwide, the growers agreed to a new rate of $2.10 compensation
per box of strawberries. Organizers risked their jobs and their safety to protest the low wages, but they ultimately won in court and
received a settlement from their employers and a commitment to have the management trained in workers’ rights.

Farmworkers have been a frontrunner in the labor rights movement, inspiring changes that are later taken up by unions and through
employee  advocacy.  However,  workers  in  this  industry  also  face  disparate  barriers  to  union  representation  and  labor  rights
legislation. California Assembly Bill 2183, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Voting Choice Act, was proposed in 2022 to
make it easier for farm workers to join or form a union by providing more options and protections when voting in a union election.
Multiple unions have come together to support this because it would establish and affirm a strong standard for individuals’ right to
collective representation in employment matters.

Beyond direct advocacy, farmworker movements also work to fill in the gaps left by current structures of exclusion. For example,
in addition to the Dolores Huerta Foundation, the UFW Foundation, and other major organizations sponsor programs to provide
farmworkers  with  food  assistance,  legal  aid,  housing  support,  educational  opportunities,  and  other  social  services  that  are  often
restricted to citizens, or underutilized by migrant communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, immigrants were excluded from
federal stimulus programs, which prompted some community groups to fundraise and provide direct aid to undocumented peoples.

While labor rights issues and immigration issues are often handled by different policies, the movements that advocate around these
topics share resources, cultural narratives, cross-ethnic solidarities, and leaders, including within Chicanx and Latinx communities.
In Figure 7.4.1, the image shows a march sponsored by the UFW for immigration reform in northern California. The larger patterns
in immigration policies contribute to many of the underlying factors of inequity in labor rights. Activists recognize this and work to
support the mutually reinforcing goals of immigrant rights and labor rights to ensure fair treatment of all communities.

Immigrant Rights Movements

When examining migration from Latin America, it is important to recognize that the term “immigrants” often also refers to Latin
American  Indigenous  peoples.  For  example,  immigrants  from  Oaxaca,  Mexico  may  also  identify  as  Indígena  (Indigenous)  and
speak a native language, such as Mixteco, Zapotec, Mazatec, Chinatec, or Mixé. Although immigrant and immigration policy
sound alike, they each play different roles in shaping the ways immigrants experience life in the United States. Immigration policy
is  about  the  laws  and  policies  that  determine  the  process  and  number  of  people  who  can  immigrate  in  various  ways,  whereas
immigrant  policy  refers  to  the  laws  and  regulations  that  impact  immigrants  currently  residing  in  the  country.  For  example,
immigration policy reflects systems such as visa lotteries and temporary worker programs, whereas immigrant policy is enforced
by federal institutions such as Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE). While some policies attempt to curtail migration by
restricting  access,  the  economic  and  military  policies  of  the  United  States  continue  to  encourage  migration,  including  through
dangerous and unauthorized migration.

In  the  United  States,  early  immigration  acts  (e.g.,  the  Immigration  Act  of  1875,  the  1882  Chinese  Exclusion  Act,  and  the  1952
Immigration  and  Nationality  Act)  enforced  racial  and  ethnic  (national)  quotas  on  immigrants  coming  to  the  United  States  and,
ironically, called for the removal of Native Americans. The use of quotas creates a baseline expectation that migration to the United
States will be carefully limited and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship will be restricted. While the U.S. uses a logic of
restriction  and  exclusion,  it  has  also  created  specific  policies  to  recruit  migrants  to  work  in  industries  where  the  domestic  labor
supply  is  failing.  For  example,  the  Bracero  Program  (1942-1965)  encouraged  a  pattern  of  cyclical  migration  by  legalizing
migration  for  individual  men  working  seasonally  on  farms.  In  1965,  the  program  was  ended  and  the  amended  Immigration  and
Nationality  Act  removed  all  country-of-origin  quotas,  which  led  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  migrants  coming  from  Latin
American  countries.  At  the  same  time,  the  U.S.  government  has  continued  to  encourage  the  flow  of  migration  by  facilitating
military  and  economic  campaigns  that  destabilize  Central  and  Latin  American  countries.  Widespread  corruption,  crime,  and
violence are exacerbated by continuous external interference, resulting in vulnerable individuals and communities seeking out new
opportunities and protection in the United States.

The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 was a major shift for immigrant communities, as it offered amnesty to
millions  of  undocumented  Mexican  migrants  living  in  the  U.S.  It  also  promised  more  punitive  policies  and  restrictions  for
immigration moving forward. Since then, policymakers have not made any structural changes to immigration policy that facilitate

pathways to citizenship or offer amnesty to undocumented workers living in the United States. Instead, politicians have focused on
encouraging  immigration  among  educated  and  professional  immigrants,  also  known  as  “brain  drain,”  while  providing  more
punitive and militarized immigrant policies, like border patrol, deportation, immigrant detention, and family separation. Pervasive
immigration and anti-immigrant policies at both state and federal levels perpetuate nativist discourses of “us” versus “them,” where
Latina/o/x immigrants are overwhelmingly portrayed by the media as criminals, invaders, and terrorists. This leads to an illegalized
identity that can have serious ramifications. The image in 7.4.2 highlights that these ramifications are often fatal, as it memorializes
the  names  of  215  people  who  died  in  immigration  detention  between  2003-2020.  Hegemonic  institutions,  like  ICE,  instill  fear
among migrants by threatening their livelihood and family life. Further, racial profiling in immigration enforcement extends this
fear to Latinx communities and people of color.

The caption on the text reads, “Immigration detention is deadly. Since 2003, 215 people have died in immigrant detention. The past
four years (2016-2020) mark an unprecedented increase in deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, their
names are shown here. COVID-19 has exacerbated the catastrophe of ICE detention – a system well-known for widespread abuse,
fatal medical neglect, horrific conditions, and a lack of due process rights. People in detention are bravely protesting and speaking
out against ICE abuses, demanding to be released immediately. Since March of 2020 there have been at least 42 confirmed hunger
strikes across the country in 24 ICE detention centers. The 24 birds represent those facilities. Both 19 month old Mariee Juárez and
42 year old Oscar Lopez Acosta died soon after being released from ICE custody. Oscar had tested positive for COVID-19. Data
provided by the Detention Watch Network (DWN).”

Advocates  focused  on  immigration  have  used  creative  strategies  to  advance  policy  goals  for  groups  who  are  formally  excluded
from political representation and legal rights in the United States. Immigrant justice movements mobilize around a range of issues
that include, but are not limited to, legal reforms around immigrant rights. This takes into account the heterogeneity of immigrant
communities whose concerns also include dignity, health, economic justice, and connections with mixed-status family members.
While  activism  focused  on  legal  rights  emphasizes  the  state’s  control  over  citizenship,  immigrant  communities  also  include
Indigenous  peoples  from  Latin  America  and  advocates  focused  on  sovereignty  and  cultural  preservation.  The  range  of  concerns
present  among  Latinx  immigrant  and  Indigenous  communities  leads  to  movements  that  combine  direct  action  with  community
support and policy change at every level (local, state, and federal).

One  common  issue  facing  both  immigrant  and  Indigenous  communities  is  language  barriers  and  access.  For  Latinx  migrant
communities,  access  to  multilingual  translation  and  interpretation  facilitates  inclusion  for  Spanish  speakers  and  Indigenous
language  speakers  within  Latinx  communities.  In  California,  the  Mixteco/Indígena  Community  Organizing  Project  (MICOP)
centralizes language interpretation in their work and lifts up Indigenous language access within networks of immigrant and health
advocates.  The  group  launched  Radio  Indígena  in  2014,  a  local  FM  station  with  over  40  hours  of  weekly  live  programming,
featuring at least seven Mixteco languages, Zapoteco, and Purépecha. This service provides information and entertainment that is
relevant to Indigenous farm working communities, such as support for low-income individuals to receive rental assistance, energy
payment  programs,  and  family-paid  leave.
  These  groups  put  into  practice  a  human  rights  framework  for  providing  holistic
support  to  communities.  In  Figure  7.4.3,  an  artist  has  depicted  a  family  traveling  in  a  pick-up  truck  accompanied  by  the  phrase
“Freedom of Movement and Family Unity are Human Rights.”

This  platform  served  a  crucial  role  in  spreading  vital  public  health  information  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  They  quickly
expanded to include Facebook Live broadcasts to supplement radio programming and demonstrate visually how testing works and
show  images  of  how  others  have  participated  in  testing.  These  events  are  interpreted  in  at  least  one  Indigenous  language,  often
through consecutive interpretation. In engaging the audience, the speakers use a conversational style. The interpreter does not just
repeat the words translated from Spanish, but rather, they have coordinated in advance to share the message in a relevant way for a
heterogeneous  audience.  For  further  accessibility,  the  videos  include  visual  aids  and  photographs  to  guide  individuals  through
practical  steps  for  how  to  access  transportation  and  where  to  arrive  for  testing.  This  visual  demonstration  helps  to  work  against
stigma  and  decrease  fear  of  health  services.  The  group  emphasized  overall  health  and  well-being  to  encourage  maximum
prevention and safety when information about transmission was limited.

## 7.5: Chicanx and Latinx Political Representation

Formal Politics in Chicanx and Latinx Communities

Political representation of Latinx communities creates opportunities to advocate for better policies and new reforms. In the U.S.,
trailblazing leaders have crossed barriers for Chicanx and Latinx communities, opening new doors for others to continue the work
of equity and justice for all. However, Latinx people remain under-represented in nearly all aspects of government and politics. In
2018, Latinx people were only 1% of all local and federal elected officials, according to the NALEO Educational Fund.
 In 2022,
that  number  is  similar,  with  only  four  U.S.  Senators  and  40  U.S.  Representatives.  Women  are  underrepresented  among  Latinx
elected  officials,  being  only  1  Senator  and  12  House  Representatives.  On  the  website  from  Rutgers  University,  you  can  explore
more statistics about women of color in politics and elected positions.

Some of the leaders for Latinx communities in politics include the U.S. Congressperson Romualdo Pacheco who was first elected
in 1879 as a Representative from California. Pacheco had previously served as the first Mexican American governor of California
in 1875. Even in states that include a high number of Latinx people and voters, such as California, researchers have identified a
pattern of underrepresentation, including in appointed and elected positions in state government, county supervisors, school board
members, and city-level positions. Groups like the California Latino School Boards Association have emerged to address some of
these  specific  issues  of  representation  and  political  power.  You  can  learn  more  about  the  California  Latino  School  Boards
Association on their website.

Federal Representation of Latinx and Hispanic People

At the federal level, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus represents the interests of Hispanic Congresspeople and it includes over 30
members including many Latinx representatives and their allies. Some Latinx Congresspeople are not members of the Caucus, in
part  due  to  partisan  divides  between  Republicans  and  Democrats.  In  the  Senate,  U.S.  Senator  Octaviano  Larrazlo  from  New
Mexico  was  the  first  Latino  and  Mexican-American  Senator  in  1928.  Despite  gains  for  representation  won  in  states  with  high
proportions  of  Latino  people,  it  took  decades  of  additional  advocacy  before  major  federal  and  judicial  positions  were  held  by
Latinos. For example, there has never been a Latinx President of the United States, Vice President, or Secretary of State. It was not
until  1988  that  Lauro  Cazavos  became  the  Secretary  of  Education  and  the  first  Latinx  or  Hispanic  person  to  serve  in  the  U.S.
Cabinet. On the U.S. Supreme Court, when Justice Sonia Sotomayor was confirmed to her position in 2009, she became the first
Latinx person and the third woman to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. In Figure 7.5.1, there is a photo of Justice Sotomayor
fulfilling  one  of  her  duties  on  the  Supreme  Court  by  swearing  in  Kamala  Harris  as  Vice  President,  who  is  another  woman  who
broke barriers as the first Black person, first Asian person, first multiracial person, and first woman to serve as Vice President of
the United States.

Figure  7.5.1:  “Supreme  Court  Justice  Sonia  Sotomayor  swears  in  Vice  President  Kamala  Harris  into  office  during  the  59th
Presidential Inauguration ceremony in Washington, Jan. 20, 2021” by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Flickr is licensed CC

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, popularly known as AOC, has been a major figure for Latinx representation in politics.
This is in part because she actively embraces her connection to the Latinx community, foregrounding her status as a young Latina

woman living in New York City, who recently paid the bills by bartending. Her continued and unapologetic presentation of herself
positions her as a capable and strong advocate for diverse people living in the United States, including immigrants, women, and
people of color. In Figure 7.5.2, she appears in a photograph, speaking passionately in front of a crowd of people.

Her passion and tenacity represent a commitment to social change and a critical lens that is relatable for many Latinx people as
well as her wide range of supporters. The video included in Video 7.5.1 describes what AOC has accomplished as a leading Latinx
political figure in her own terms. The video is 4 minutes and 44 seconds long, and it demonstrates the way that Latinx politicians
have made a considerable impact on their field and on our broader society.

Politics and Liberation

Many members of Latinx communities are disengaged from formal political processes, including voting and representation. This is
in part due to the exclusion of immigrants from voting, which prevents families from engaging in a shared practice of voting and
being represented. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has had a significant impact on Latino people and their political participation in
the United States. Prior to the Act, many Latinos faced barriers and discriminatory practices that limited their access to the voting
booth, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and intimidation tactics. The Act aimed to combat these obstacles and ensure equal voting
rights for all citizens, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

The Voting Rights Act has helped empower Latino communities by prohibiting discriminatory practices and ensuring their political
representation.  It  has  led  to  increased  voter  registration  and  turnout  among  Latinos,  enabling  them  to  elect  candidates  of  their
choice and have a stronger voice in the political process. By eliminating discriminatory voting practices, the Act has paved the way
for greater political engagement and representation for Latino individuals and communities.

The Raza Unida party, founded in the late 1960s, emerged as a political movement that sought to address the issues and concerns of
Mexican Americans and other Latino groups. The party advocated for self-determination, civil rights, and political empowerment
for  the  Latino  community.  It  aimed  to  challenge  the  existing  two-party  system  and  provide  an  alternative  political  platform  for
Latino voters. While the Raza Unida party made significant strides in mobilizing and organizing Latino communities, its influence
and  success  were  relatively  short-lived.  The  party  faced  internal  divisions  and  external  challenges,  including  legal  battles  and
limited resources. However, it played a crucial role in raising awareness about the issues faced by Latinos and fostering a sense of
political empowerment among the community.

Overall,  the  Voting  Rights  Act  has  been  instrumental  in  expanding  political  rights  and  opportunities  for  Latino  individuals  and
communities, while the Raza Unida party served as a catalyst for political mobilization and empowerment during a crucial period
in Latino political history. However, in recent years, there have been changes that have weakened the effectiveness of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. One significant development was the Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder in 2013. In this case, the
Court struck down a key provision of the Act, namely Section 4(b), which established a formula for identifying jurisdictions with a
history of voting discrimination that were required to obtain federal preclearance before making changes to their voting laws.

The Court's decision effectively invalidated the formula used to determine which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, arguing
that  it  was  based  on  outdated  data  and  no  longer  reflective  of  current  conditions.  As  a  result,  the  preclearance  requirement  was
effectively nullified unless Congress could enact a new formula. This ruling has had implications for Latino voters, among others,
as  it  removed  a  critical  safeguard  against  discriminatory  voting  laws  and  practices.  In  the  absence  of  preclearance,  jurisdictions
have been able to implement changes to voting laws without prior federal approval, potentially leading to the adoption of laws that
disproportionately impact minority communities, including Latinos.

Since the Shelby County decision, there have been concerns about the rise of voter suppression efforts, including the adoption of
stricter voter identification laws, reductions in early voting periods, purging of voter rolls, and gerrymandering. These measures
can disproportionately affect marginalized communities, including Latinos, by making it more difficult for them to exercise their
right to vote and diminishing their political representation.

Efforts  to  restore  and  strengthen  the  Voting  Rights  Act  have  been  made  in  Congress,  such  as  the  proposed  John  Lewis  Voting
Rights Advancement Act. This legislation seeks to update the coverage formula and restore the preclearance requirement, aiming to
address  the  challenges  created  by  the  Shelby  County  decision.  However,  the  act's  passage  has  faced  obstacles  and  partisan
divisions,  resulting  in  ongoing  debates  about  voting  rights  and  protections  for  historically  marginalized  communities,  including
Latino voters.

Beyond  that,  many  Latinx  people  also  share  the  critical  perspective  that  the  U.S.  government  itself  and  U.S.  society  are  built
around  principles  of  division,  exclusion,  and  exploitation  and  must  be  critically  examined  and  transformed.  Under  this  view,
participation  in  the  system  only  serves  to  encourage  people  to  believe  in  the  possibility  of  reform,  while  ultimately  failing  to
address  the  root  causes  of  racism,  xenophobia,  and  intersectional  oppression.  Among  Native  American  and  Latinx  Indigenous
peoples, this sentiment can be accompanied by a commitment to tribal sovereignty and the creation of modern systems rooted in
traditional and sacred relationships with the land.

Figure 7.5.3: “Puerto Rican Flag in Old San Juan” by Lorie Shaull, Wikimedia is licensed CC BY 2.0.

The  contradictions  of  political  representation  can  also  be  seen  in  Puerto  Rico,  which  is  a  U.S.  territory.  Although  the  people  of
Puerto  Rico  bear  many  of  the  responsibilities  of  U.S.  citizenship,  including  paying  taxes,  being  drafted,  and  following  the  laws
created by the government, they are not politically represented at the federal level. You can see a Puerto Rican flag hanging in Old
San Juan in Figure 7.5.3, showing the people’s pride in their island. More recently, this lack of representation has had devastating
effects in the face of increased hurricanes in the region and the larger dynamics of climate change. While Puerto Ricans are clearly
not  represented  equally  in  the  U.S.  governmental  system,  the  people  of  the  island  remain  persistently  divided  as  to  whether  to
pursue statehood or independence. The Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act, also known as H.R. 4901 and later reintroduced as
H.R. 1522, is a bill that was presented during the 116th and 117th sessions of the United States Congress. Its purpose is to enable
Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, to become a state within the Union. The bill was initially introduced
in the 116th Congress and reintroduced in the 117th Congress as H.R. 1522 on March 2, 2021. The continued debate over statehood
efforts  shows  how  diversity  of  perspective  within  Latinx  communities  and  in  solidarity  with  other  racial  and  ethnic  groups
ultimately contributes to the use of multiple strategies in advocacy and politics. This creates opportunities for future generations to
continue the struggle and find new solutions to long-standing systems of white supremacy, xenophobia, and settler colonialism.

## 7.6: Conclusion

Summary

In this chapter, we explained the dynamics of struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation among Chicanx
and Latinx communities. Exploring these topics showed us the various focus areas among Chicanx and Latinx social movements
and advocacy groups, including things like civil rights, Indigenous sovereignty, solidarity, queer, feminist, and intersectional issues,
labor rights, and political mobilization and representation.

This  chapter  also  explored  how  historical  and  contemporary  Chicanx  and  Latinx  movements  have  enacted  equity,  self-
determination, liberation, decolonization, sovereignty, and anti-racism. Movements have been successful in raising awareness about
issues,  creating  opportunities  for  communities  to  take  charge  of  their  own  destiny,  and  confronting  and  changing  policies  that
oppress Chicanx and Latinx peoples. At the same time, these movements have navigated substantial barriers, which impede their
goals and allow for systemic racism and settler-colonialism to continuously operate. Only through sustained collective action can
individual acts of advocacy lead to a larger change.

Finally,  throughout  this  chapter,  we  critically  analyzed  the  uses  of  intersectionality  among  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  to
understand  how  movements  address  class,  gender,  sexuality,  national  origin,  immigration  status,  sovereignty,  and  language.
Together, these learning tools can prepare you to take action in your own community, in solidarity with existing and new groups
that are working to make change. There are also many more topics to explore and learn about, which is always an important first
step for all activists and social movement groups.

and discussion prompts, and suggested assignments and activities.

Key Terms

Chicana Movidas: A political framework that is rooted in an intersectional perspective, acknowledging the uniquely racialized and
gendered experiences of Chicanas, as well as the value of using transformative and innovative approaches to build coalitions and
advocate for social change.

Chicanismo: A political framework that calls for justice and liberation for Chicano communities, which was widely mobilized in
the  1960s  as  a  response  to  pervasive  social,  economic,  and  racial  issues  in  the  United  States,  especially  the  Vietnam  War,
segregation, and discrimination.

Reform movements: Movements that involve advocacy and mobilization to accomplish focused, limited goals that change laws,
regulations, and policies within existing organizations and institutions. These movements respond directly to the needs of groups
that are currently being harmed.

Revolutionary movements: Movements that advocate for transformative changes in society that include abolishing, replacing, and
fundamentally challenging the institutions that exist. These movements work to address the root causes of inequality.

Reactionary movements: Movements that work against other movements, often through direct opposition or by countering their
activity. Reactionary movements are often politically conservative and form in response to the gains of historically marginalized
groups.

Jim  Crow  and  Juan  Crow: An  era  of  legal  segregation  that  focused  on  maintaining  social  and  structural  separations  between
white people and Black and Brown people. These specific laws were most prominent in the late 1800s, as a response to the end of
slavery, and they maintained this form until the middle of the 1900s when they were challenged by civil rights movements.

El  Plan  Espiritual  de  Aztlán:  A  document  that  inspired  and  motivated  Chicanx  activists  to  pursue  liberation  and  justice,
especially  in  education.  This  document  was  published  during  the  1969  Chicano  Youth  Conference  hosted  by  Rodolfo  “Corky”
Gonzalez in Denver, Colorado. The seven goals laid out in the plan focus on unity, economy, education, institutions, self-defense,
cultural values, and political liberation.

The Chicano Moratorium (The National Chicano Moratorium Committee Against the Vietnam War): A movement of anti-
war activists opposed to the U.S. military’s role in Vietnam. The protest emphasized how the war was disproportionately impacting
Chicano and Chicanx communities.

Intersectional  standpoint:  The  unique  knowledge  and  perspective  developed  based  on  the  combination  of  one’s  multiple
identities, especially race and gender, as well as sexuality, immigration status, ability, age, religion, and other social categories.

United Farm Workers (UFW): A labor rights and social movement organization that was founded by Dolores Huerta and Cesar
Chavez  in  central  California.  This  group  represented  the  predominantly  migrant  labor  force  in  the  fields  and  built  solidarities
between Mexican origin communities and Filipinxs. The UFW still operates today to advocate for labor rights and has inspired the
formation and mobilization of multiple organizations that serve, represent, and advocate for farmworkers.

Immigrant  and  immigration  policy:  Laws  that  influence  immigrant  experiences  and  the  rates  of  immigration  in  a  country.
Whereas  immigrant  policy  regulates  the  experiences  of  people  who  have  already  immigrated  to  the  country,  immigration  policy
refers to the processes and practices that influence the process of migration itself.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 8: Education and Activism

 Learning Objectives

Explore concepts to critically understand key education debates, issues, and initiatives.
Identify historical and contemporary issues, policies, and laws in public education that have impacted Chicanx/Latinx
communities.
Describe the practices, tactics, strategies, and movements that emerge from Chicanx/Latinx communities to reform and
transform the educational landscape.

Introduction

This  chapter  explores  public  education  in  California  as  a  site  of  struggle,  resilience,  and  transformation  for  students,  caregivers,
families, and communities of Latin American heritage. Schools do not exist outside of the historical context that informs them nor
do they exist outside of the society they are situated in. Therefore, the struggle for education is also a struggle that intersects with
the struggle for justice in housing, employment, health, immigrant/human rights, and self-determination. This chapter provides a
historical  overview  that  is  not  meant  to  be  comprehensive,  but  rather  provides  historical  snapshots  into  the  ways  Latinx
communities have been shaped by and have shaped public education.

As  education  remains  a  site  of  politics  and  power,  each  generation  builds  upon  the  legacy  of  those  that  came  before  them.  The
struggle  for  educational  self-determination  is  multifaceted––at  times  it  can  look  like  families  arguing  in  courts  about  the
constitutionality of laws, students walking out of their schools, or community leaders creating autonomous schools. All of these
efforts  were  effective  in  acquiring  and  enacting  people  power  and  doing  so  in  solidarity  with  other  historically  minoritized
communities.  Collectively,  these  struggles  have  transformed  the  educational  landscape  and  it  is  the  activist  legacy  on  which  we
continue to build upon.

## 8.1: The Crisis and Hope in Education

Community Cultural Wealth as a Tool for Social Justice

Today Latinx students make up 54% of the student population in California K-12 schools, yet they remain a numerical minority
when  it  comes  to  educational  attainment  in  all  of  the  critical  transitions  between  elementary  school,  high  school,  college,  and
graduate  school.   In  fact,  according  to  the  Chicano  Studies  Research  Center  2015  report  “Still  Falling  Through  the  Cracks:
Revisiting the Latina/o Educational Pipeline,” the Latinx student population is falling behind all other major racial/ethnic groups in
the U.S.   What  attributes  to  the  cracks  causing  Latinx  students  to  "leak  out  of"  the  educational  pipeline?  Patricia  Gandara  and
Frances Contreras tackled this question in their book, The Latino Education Crisis pointing to failed social policies that position
Latinx  children  at  a  disadvantage,  even  before  they  enter  school.   The  authors  point  to  the  need  for  comprehensive  support  in
health care, quality school facilities, enriched curriculum, qualified teachers, language support, and intervention/support programs.
Furthermore, they point to poverty, segregation, and the lack of a sense of belonging that students and their families experience in
schools.

The American public educational system from its inception was inherently violent for Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC),
and immigrants. Referring to the educational experiences of Black children, Bettina Love (2016) builds upon critical race and legal
scholar, Patricia Williams (1991), articululation of “spirit murder” within the school context, noting it “is the denial of inclusion,
protection,  safety,  nurturance,  and  acceptance  because  of  fixed,  yet  fluid  and  moldable,  structures  of  racism.” The  everyday
attempts  to  kill  the  aspirations  and  spirits  of  BIPOC  in  education  occurs  methodically  through  systemic,  institutionalized,  state-
sanctioned violence built on racism and colonization. Education has never been able to fully humanize our existence, recognize our
intellectual  brilliance,  and  offer  a  place  of  protection.  Instead,  the  educational  system  has  historically  been  informed  by  deficit-
based discourses that communicate a particular view of Latinx cultures, histories, and traditions as backward, inferior, deficient,
and an impediment to educational success.

 Pause and Reflect

Muxerista  and  joteria  activist-scholar  and  professor  Anita  Tierina  Revilla  (2021)  defines  spirit  protectors  and  spirit
restorers "as people, places, organizations, beliefs, and/or practices (they can also be art, poetry, books, music, and dance) that
give  marginalized  people  the  strength  to  reject  and  survive  attempted  spirit  murder  and/or  restore  our  wounded  spirits,
especially  in  the  face  of  repeated  attacks  and  woundings  both  inside  and  outside  of  institutions  of  education.”   While  it  is
important to name and identify the trauma inflicted violence caused by education, we must equally make space to ask, “Who
are your spirit protectors and your spirit restorers?"

Critical  Race  Theory  scholars  have  challenged  dominant  orientations  of  education  with  asset-based  discourses,  noting  that
working-class Latinx students in particular come from communities with extensive funds of knowledge (i.e. skills, abilities, ideas,
practices)  that  schools  do  not  reflect  or  honor.   Funds  of  knowledge  view  households  and  communities  as  essential  educational
settings  where  learning  takes  place  and  knowledge  is  generated,  transmitted,  and  preserved,  providing  a  form  of  non-monetary
educational capital or value that is either unrecognized and when it is, is devalued in mainstream education.

Chicana  education  scholar  Tara  Yosso  contributes  to  this  understanding  of  educational  capital,  adding  that  students  possess  six
forms of cultural capital, which she identified as community cultural wealth (aspirational, familial, social, navigational, resistant,
linguistic).   From  this  standpoint,  Latinx  cultures  are  an  asset  not  a  detriment  to  student  educational  success  and  achievement.
Taking it one step further, Yosso and Burciaga remind us that a focus on the cultural wealth of Latinx communities is foundational
to  locating  how  communities  acquire  and  enact  power  in  the  educational  landscape.  The  community  cultural  wealth  of
marginalized groups strengthens their survival and resistance to racism and other forms of oppression. This theoretical orientation
allows us to observe what we may miss otherwise due to active projects of erasure, co-optation, marginalization, and re-writing of
our histories.

 Theory Spotlight: Tara Yosso's Community Cultural Wealth Framework

Aspirational capital refers to the ability to maintain hopes and dreams for the future, even in the face of real and perceived
barriers.
Linguistic capital includes the intellectual and social skills attained through communication in multiple languages and/or
language styles (including communication through art, music, poetry, theater, and dance)

Social capital can be understood as networks of people and community resources.
Navigational capital refers to skills in maneuvering through social institutions. Historically, this implies the ability to
maneuver through institutions not created with Communities of Color in mind.
Familial capital refers to cultural knowledges nurtured among familia (kin) that carry a sense of community history,
memory, and cultural intuition.
Resistant capital refers to those knowledges and skills fostered through oppositional behavior that challenge inequality.

“As we consider the generations of communities who have preserved and passed down cultural wealth despite harsh conditions, let
us  be  fierce  visionaries  for  generating  opportunities  to  cultivate  community  cultural  wealth  as  a  tool  of  reclamation––a  tool  for
social justice.”  The act of reclaiming our stories is a tool for social justice. This chapter  presents historical snapshots in which
Latinx communities activated change in education and society, employing and expanding their community cultural wealth in the
process of doing so.
 It is through these activist traditions that Latinx communities continue to maintain hope and possibility to
activate change today.

## 8.2: The Struggle for Equality, 1900-1954

Education for Social Control

The  educational  system  was  historically  created  to  sustain  and  perpetuate  notions  that  equate  whiteness  and  American  as
synonymous. For people of Mexican descent, the question of race has always been a complicated one. When the peace treaty that
ended the U.S. invasion of Mexico was signed and the U.S. annexed ⅓ of Mexico, in exchange, Mexicans in the newly conquered
territories  were  granted  federal  U.S.  citizenship  and  racially  categorized  as  white  (Review  Chapter  2:  Identities).  The  racial  re-
designation of Mexicans under American colonization held no power in everyday life, especially in educational institutions as the
practice of segregation of Mexican children is dated back to as early as the 1880s. Education is often perceived as a benevolent
system and a gateway to social mobility, however, tracing it’s history allows us to see education as a site used to maintain racialized
hierarchies and power. Figure 8.2.1 captures this sentiment today, reading, fight poverty not the poor. This is particularly significant
for  Latinx  communities  that  continue  to  endure  the  historical  legacy  of  colonization,  white  supremacy,  racism,  assimilation,
xenophobia, and discrimination in schools.

At  the  turn  of  the  20th  century,  the  1896  Supreme  Court  decision  in  Plessy  vs.  Ferguson  ruled  that  racial  segregation  was
constitutional so long as it was equal. This historic ruling justified an era of segregation at a time when the U.S. also experienced
the  first  major  immigration  wave  of  Latinxs,  that  is,  1.5  million  Mexicans  entered  from  1900-1930  due  to  the  Mexican
  The  ruling  also  came  at  a  time  when  a  Chinese  family  successfully  won  against  the  San  Francisco  Board  of
Revolution.
Education when their child was denied entry in school. The California Supreme Court decision in Tape v. Hurley (1885) effectively
ruled that all minority children, including immigrants, were entitled to attend public schools in California. While anti-Asian hatred
found new ways of creating “separate but equal” schools for Asian children,
 the question of whether children of Mexican descent
could legally be separated would become central in this time period.

Mexican  and  Mexican  American  families  lived  in  segregated  colonias  and  barrios  that  often  lacked  basic  necessities  such  as
plumbing and electricity.
 Overt racism  through  signage  read,  for  example,  “We  serve  Whites  only.  No  Spanish  or  Mexicans”
was common in restaurants, theaters, bowling alleys, parks, and swimming pools (Review Section 7.2: Chicanx and Latinx Civil
Rights Activism). When not visible, such as in schools, the practices of exclusion and discrimination were present. Unlike Native
American and Asian American students that endured education codes that granted schools the right to legally segregate them, the
practice of segregating Mexican American students prevailed despite their white racial categorization.

Americanization and Eugenics

For  children  of  Mexican  descent,  the  denial  of  access  to  equal  quality  educational  opportunities  given  to  Anglo  students  was
justified  through  Americanization  efforts.
  The  Americanization  movement  of  the  early  20th  century  was  intended  to  help  new
immigrants assimilate into America’s civic culture and skilled workforce. Americanization aimed to change Mexican students who
were  characterized  as  dirty,  un-Christian,  and  lacking  social  morals  and  etiquette.  Central  to  this  was  assimilation,  the  process
whereby  a  historically  marginalized  person  or  group  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  adopt  the  social,  psychological,  cultural,  and
political characteristics of a dominant group. As Chicano historian Gilbert Gonzalez noted, the first segregated school for Mexican
children  was  established  in  Orange  County,  California  in  1919  and  by  1930,  there  were  15  Mexican  schools  throughout  the
county.
  Yet,  not  all  children  of  Mexican  descent  were  equally  discriminated  against.  A  study  of  Oxnard’s  segregated  school
system in the early 1900s exposed how school officials used race, class, hygiene, and skin tone to identify “a few of the brightest,
cleanest Mexican children.”

Schools became one of the main functions of the Americanization movement, and for children of Mexican heritage, efforts instilled
that their Mexican culture impeded their academic success. Language was often the target of these efforts and special classes were
designed so as not to impede the education of their Anglo peers. Mexican children were often placed into lower-level courses or
placed into segregated “Mexican schools” altogether.

In addition to Americanization, eugenics was a popular ideology that informed ideas of race and intelligence. Eugenics ideology is
rooted in the belief that the white Anglo race is genetically superior and to maintain this group’s racial purity, it informed social
policies,  programs,  and  practices  set  out  to  control  “undesirable”  populations.  For  a  review  on  this  topic,  you  can  also  review
Chapter 2. As noted by Valencia, Menchaca, and Donato (2002), “Historically, the rationale used to socially segregate Mexicans
was based on the racial perspective that Mexicans were ‘Indian,’ or at best ‘half-breed savages’ who were not suited to interact
with Whites.”

Mexican American students were regarded as intellectually inferior, culturally backward, and linguistically deprived. One of the
key  instruments  to  determine  a  person’s  intelligence  prominently  used  in  schools  was  the  Intelligence  Quotient  (IQ)  test,  a
standardized test that supported the racialized view that students of color were intellectually inferior to whites because they scored
a  lower  IQ  score.  This  institutionalization  of  racism  systematically  tracked  students  in  lower-level  courses,  and  vocational  trade
training, and deprived them of opportunities to succeed.
 Although Mexican children were classified as white, they “were by far
the most segregated group in California public education by the end of the 1920s.”

The Lemon Grove Case

School segregation was met with resistance from families throughout the Southwest. On July 23, 1930, the all-white school board
members of the Lemon Grove School District decided to place all students of Mexican descent attending the elementary school in
an  inferior  quality,  two-room  building  near  the  Mexican  colonia  of  Lemon  Grove,  California.  The  school  board  members  cited
concerns with overcrowding, sanitation, social morals, and language as justification for the separation. Essentially, the school board
argued that white students were held back when teachers needed to cater to the needs of Mexican students. The concerns of the
school  board,  along  with  the  all-white  Parent  Teacher  Associated  that  began  the  effort  and  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  who
supported the move, relied on coded language. Coded language is a practice long used in policy in which race-neutral terms are
used  to  disguise  the  racist  motives  that  maintain  power  structures  meant  to  sustain  white  supremacy.  Citing  clogged  toilets  and
student overpopulation are euphemisms for race without stating race explicitly. Video 8.2.1 is of Luis Alvarez, grandchild of the
plaintiffs in the Lemon Grove case, recounting how his familial history inspired him to become a historian.

Chicano historian Luis Alvarez, whose grandparents, Roberto and Mary Alvarez, were students in Lemon Grove during that time,
recounts the political context of that era in the following way.

This is an important chapter in the history of Chicanx and Latinx San Diego and not just because they won, the Mexican
community in Lemon Grove took a stand against fierce odds. They challenged the white power brokers in their community
that ran the school board. They risked losing their jobs amid the Great Depression. They faced the prospect of deportation
during what was a nationwide repatriation campaign that saw more than 600,000 Mexicans returned to Mexico, including
countless  numbers  of  Mexican  American-born  children.  And  yet  they  came  together,  in  the  tradition  of  immigrant
mutualistas to form the Lemon Grove Neighborhood Association and fight.

Responding  to  oppressive  conditions  with  the  aid  of  mutualistas  was  essential.  Mutualistas  are  community-based  mutual  aid
societies created by Mexican immigrants to connect them with a network that links their homeland and new home with resources,

support, and a community. The Mexican parents drew upon their social networks and organized to boycott what they referred to as
a caballeriza (horse stable or animal farm). With assistance from the Mexican embassy and newly formed organizations such as
 they won what became the first successful school desegregation case in Alvarez vs. The Board of Trustees of the Lemon
LULAC,
Grove School District (1931). To learn more about the founding of LULAC, review Section 7.2: Chicanx and Latinx Civil Rights
Activism). The court ruled that children of Mexican heritage were unlawfully segregated because Mexicans are racially considered
Caucasian, therefore, schools cannot segregate Caucasian students from other Caucasian students.

In California, the case against the Lemon Grove School District helped to defeat growing political attempts such as the 1931 Bliss
Bill  that  was  introduced  by  Assemblyman  George  R.  Bliss  of  Carpinteria  to  re-categorize  Mexicans  as  “Indian”  rather  than
“white.”  A  legal  redefinition  of  Mexican  children  as  “Indian  children  whether  born  in  the  United  States  or  not”  would  have

  While  victorious  for  the  local  Mexican  families  of  Lemon  Grove,
resistance to segregated schools continued across California and the Southwest.

The Mendez et. al. Case

In California, de jure, the legal practice of segregation ended as a result of the class-action lawsuit, Mendez, et. al v. Westminster
School District (1947).
 (For further reading on the Mendez case, review Section 7.2 Chicanx and Latinx Civil Rights Activism).
At  the  height  of  WWII,  when  Japanese  American  families  were  forcibly  evacuated  and  relocated  to  internment  camps,  among
them  was  the  Munemitsus  family  of  Westminster.  The  Mendez  family  moved  to  Westminster  from  Santa  Ana  because  an
opportunity  opened  to  lease  and  run  a  40  acre  asparagus  farm  that  belonged  to  the  Munemitsus  family.
  The  Mendez  family
managed this farm that was labored by Mexican Braceros. To learn more about the Bracero program, review Section 7.4: Labor,
Farmworker, and Immigrant Movements, or Section ## 4.4: Gender, Sexuality, Migration, and Indigeneity.

In 1944, Gonzalo and Felicita Mendez’s Mexican-Puerto Rican children were denied enrollment into their neighborhood school,
the  same  school  where  their  nieces  attended.  In  an  attempt  to  enroll  their  children,  their  aunt  went  to  the  school.  The  Mendez
daughter,  Sylvia,  remembered  that  moment  as  an  adult  in  Video  8.2.2,  which  is  Sandra  Robbie’s  documentary,  “Mendez  v.
Westminster: For All the Children.” A picture of Sylvia Mendez is shown in Figure 8.2.2.

So when we got to the school they told her, "Mrs. Vidarri, you can leave your kids here but your brother’s kids will have to
go to the Mexican school. The Mexicans are segregated here in Westminster. They have to go to the Mexican school."

Since her Mexican American aunt married a French man with the last name Vidaurri and their children were light-skinned, easily
passing  as  white,  they  were  allowed  to  enroll  in  the  “white”  neighborhood  school.  The  colorism,  that  is,  the  prejudice  or
discrimination based on dark skin color, enacted by the school demonstrates the complexity and proximity of whiteness available to
some in the Mexican community and not to others.

Figure 8.2.2: “Sylvia Mendez” by Duke University, Wikimedia Commons is in the Public Domain, CC0.

In this scenario, we learn that whiteness was not necessarily available to all Mexicans, including the Mendez family who despite
their higher class standing from operating a farm and owning a cantina (bar) business in Santa Ana, they remained unsuccessful in
accessing the “white” school because their skin was much darker than that of their relatives.
 What their class standing did give
them, however, was the financial means to fight segregation legally in court. Ultimately, the Mendez case was successful it but did
not  go  unchallenged  in  the  Court  of  Appeals.  The  Mendez  case  received  an  outpour  of  support  from  organizations  such  as  the
National  Association  for  the  Advancement  of  Colored  People  (NAACP),  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  (ACLU),  Japanese
American Citizens League (JACL), and American Jewish Congress (AJC) that all submitted briefs in support of their case. In their
brief, AJC mentioned, “We believe, indeed, that the Jewish interests are inseparable from those of justice and that Jewish interests
are threatened whenever persecution, discrimination, or humiliation is inflicted upon any human being because of his race, creed,
color, language, or ancestry.”

The  solidarity  of  all  the  organizations  and  community  leaders  who  were  able  to  recognize  that  while  they  may  be  racialized
differently,  there  are  shared  interests  in  challenging  racism.  They  were  able  to  prove  that  separate  schools  violated  the  equal
protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, not on grounds of racial discrimination, but national origin because
after all, no one contested whether the children were white, but rather, that discrimination was based on their Mexican and Latin
national origin.
 As a result of growing state-wide political momentum in support of desegregation, state Governor Earl Warren
signed legislation in the state to repeal state law segregating American Indians and Asian Americans, effectively outlawing state-
sanctioned  de  jure  segregation.
  Figure  8.2.3  showcases  the  first  issue  stamp  released  in  2007  celebrating  60  years  after  the
Mendez vs. Westminster School District case.

Nationally,  segregation  was  legal  until  it  was  challenged  with  the  Supreme  Court  decision  with  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education
Topeka (1954).
 Chicana sociologist and lawyer Marisela Martinez-Cola argues, the success of Brown was in part due to the over
100 legal challenges to segregation in state and federal courts, among them the victories led by Latinx families.

Education has historically been an issue over civil rights denied, the right to a free public education. In this section we learned that
Latinx families struggled for civil rights in education, paving the way for future movements in education. While segregated schools
were now ruled unconstitutional, it is important to remember that white supremacist ideologies that inform a person’s racialized
worldview  and  maintain  divides  do  not  change  overnight.  Latinx  families  continued  to  endure  discrimination  in  housing,
employment,  and  schools.  The  growth  of  urbanization  and  suburbanization  across  California  would  contribute  to  de  facto
segregation in housing and schools, introducing a new era of social change.

 LULAC was first formed in Texas in 1927 for the purpose of ending discrimination. During this era, LULAC was instrumental
in  fighting  school  segregation  cases.  While  many  scholars  have  regarded  LULAC  as  an  assimilationist,  anti-immigrant,  anti-
working class organization, Cynthia E. Orozco offers a re-reading of LULAC’s history in No Mexicans, Women, or Dogs Allowed:
The Rise of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2009).

  The  1930  Census  classified  “Mexican  American”  as  a  race,  receiving  an  outpour  of  backlash  from  the  newly  established
organization, LULAC, to classify Mexicans as white. In 1940, there was a reclassification of Mexicans as white in U.S. Census as a
protection  mechanism  in  light  of  internment  of  Japanese  Americans,  which  used  Census  data  to  locate  Japanese-Americans.  To
learn more, read “On the Census, Who Checks ‘Hispanic,’ Who Checks ‘White,’ and Why,” Code Switch, NPR, June 16, 2014.

 The Bliss bill called for an amendment to section 3.3 of the California school code which provided local school districts with
“the  power  to  establish  separate  schools  for  lndian  children,  and  children  of  Chinese,  Japanese,  and  Mongolian  ancestry.”
Assemblyman Bliss wanted the section dealing with Indian children modified to read “Indian children whether born in the United

States or not” to give schools the authority to separate Mexican and Mexican American students from their Anglo counterparts on
the  grounds  that  “la  raza  children  were  Indians.”  To  read  more  about  efforts  to  re-define  Mexicans  as  “Indian”  to  justify  legal
segregation  in  schools,  review  Francisco  E.  Balderrama  In  Defense  of  La  Raza:  The  Los  Angeles  Mexican  Consulate  and  the

 It is worth noting that while the Mendez family is often highlighted in this case, it was a class-action case that involved other
families, including Thomas Estrada, William Guzman, Frank Palomino and Lorenzo Ramirez who joined as co-plaintiffs against

## 8.3: Re-imagining Education in an Era of Revolt, 1955-1975

Education for Liberation

Education has always been a central function of colonization and oppression, but when reclaimed by oppressed people it can be a
key  function  for  liberation  struggles.  As  the  struggle  for  civil  rights  continued  into  a  new  era  of  social  change,  it  created
opportunities for students, families, and activists to re-imagine their local schools and education in general. While today it may be
easy to take for granted the existence of ethnic studies classes such as the one you are in, it is important to know that the field was
created and sustained as a result of political pressure by social movements. Before the formation of ethnic studies, communities
that were historically marginalized took education into their own hands, such as offering political education and presenting counter
cultures,  such  as  art,  murals,  teatro,  and  music  to  uphold  values  and  norms  contrary  to  mainstream  society  (Visit  Chapter  10:
Cultural Productions). These non-traditional forms of education are among the many ways that history is recorded, disseminated,
and preserved.

The  Chicano  movement  (Review  Chapter  7:  Social  Movement  Activity  for  a  history  of  the  Chicano  movement),  and  other
movements of the time, such as the antiwar and women’s rights movements, collectively are examples of different communities
taking more militant approaches to generating political power. During these times, younger generations of Mexican Americans also
redefined their identity to include radical political identities such as Chicana and Chicano that extended beyond their ethnicity and
united in solidarity with peoples of the “third world” to create change (Review Chapter # 1: Foundations and Contexts and Section
7.2:  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Civil  Rights  Activism).  The  education  that  occurred  in  and  out  of  schools,  ignited  and  sustained
generations of activists working to transform their high schools, colleges, and universities. During this time, the struggle was no
longer merely about access to education, but questioning the function and responsibility of educational institutions altogether.

Little School of the 400

The  absence  of  effective  schools  to  address  the  discrimination  Mexican  American  children  experienced,  led  to  the  formation  of
schools that were run by Mexican Americans. In 1957, one such school was spearheaded by LULAC. The Little School of the 400
(LS400) was a preschool program that was first created in Texas to teach Spanish-speaking children to be bilingual by teaching
them 400 English words. These preschool classes would help children build their English vocabulary, giving them the academic
confidence  to  succeed  in  school.  The  LS400  was  an  initiative  to  Americanize  children  of  Mexican  heritage,  but  unlike
Americanization  efforts  led  by  whites,  this  school  did  not  instill  a  sense  of  inferiority.
  Instead,  it  was  a  school  that  instilled
cultural pride and empowered children to be embrace their Mexican and American culture.

These classes were taught by Mexican American women, such as Isabel Verner, who was the first to pilot the program in Ganado,
Texas.
  The  success  of  the  LS400  schools  in  Texas  served  as  a  model  for  the  nationally  sponsored  Head  Start  Program  that
emerged during the “War on Poverty” initiatives by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration.

The East LA School Blowouts

In March of 1968 in East Los Angeles, California the country witnessed a series of walkouts across high schools like never before.
According  to  La  Raza  Newspaper,  “The  first  15  days  of  March  of  the  year  1968  will  be  known  in  the  ‘new’  history  of  the
Southwest  as  the  days  of  the  BLOWOUT.  Chicano  Students  define  Blowout  as  ‘high  school  students  walking  out  for  a  better
education.’”  An estimated 15,000 students walked out of classes from seven high schools, what became known as the East LA
blowouts. The students gathered the results from surveys they created and compiled a list of 26 student demands that addressed a
range  of  issues  with  academics,  administration,  facilities,  and  student  rights.  In  their  demands,  students  called  for  culturally
relevant  and  responsive  education,  critiqued  the  lack  of  college  preparatory  courses,  and  the  punitive  school  culture.  The  list  of
demands  was  presented  to  the  LA  Board  of  Education  on  March  28,  1968  only  to  be  denied  in  front  of  the  more  than  1,200

The  walkouts  were  made  possible  because  the  students  had  the  support  of  their  community.  Salvador  “Sal”  Castro,  a  teacher  at
Lincoln  High  School,  who  extended  his  support  to  the  students,  recruited  students  to  attend  the  Chicano  Youth  Leadership

Conference,
 a space that was critical to nurturing political identities among Chicana/o youth of the time. Among those students
was Moctesuma Esparza, a student of Mr. Castro at Lincoln High School. Moctesuma remembered those pivotal years for a PBS
documentary titled, “Civic Leader Moctesuma Esparza: Educational Equity”

A group of young Chicano students, we were 10th graders, 11th graders, formed an organization called Young Citizens for
Community Action. And we would get together on weekends and we would talk about what was wrong, what was wrong in
our schools, what was wrong in our lives and our community? Why was it that our teachers were not encouraging us to go to
college? We had plenty of shop classes at Lincoln but almost no honors classes. We were being trained to be laborers. The
schools were like prisons. We couldn’t use the restrooms. We were punished. We were spanked for speaking Spanish. And all
of the students were unhappy about that. We talked about what we could do to make a difference? ‘All right, we need to take
a lesson from what's going on in the rest of the world.’ The plan was, we walk out.

Young Citizens for Community Action initially formed in 1965, while Moctesuma was in high school, and eventually evolved into
the  United  Mexican  American  Students  (UMAS)  and  Brown  Berets  while  he  was  a  student  at  the  University  of  California  Los
Angeles. Moctesuma recounts the role of university students in mentoring local high school students stating,

They wanted to be organized. They wanted to do something, and so what we did at that point as college students was provide
them  context  and  assist  them.  And  they  made  all  of  their  decisions.  It  was  an  extremely  democratic  movement.  The  high
school  students  were  very  jealous  of  their  own  prerogatives  and  of  their  own  independence.  And  what  we  did  as  college
students  was  to  provide  a  safety  net  for  them  once  they  did  decide  to  walk  out,  to  act  as  monitors  and  as  security  for  the
movement,  and  provide  resources  and  the  community  support  system  to  then  begin  to  reach  out  to  parents  and  to  labor
movements and to the clergy. So we went about it very methodically. It took us a couple of years.

The students in East LA had support from their parents, political organizations, and former students. By offering the community
independent forms of communication through newspapers such as La Raza, Inside Eastside, and The Chicano Student, activists in
East LA were able to control the narrative and inform the community, galvanizing their support, which was crucial to their success.

The  movement  that  was  forming  around  the  walkouts  was  actively  repressed  by  school  administrators  and  law  enforcement
agencies.  High  school  seniors  who  were  recipients  of  scholarships  were  threatened  with  having  their  scholarships  taken  away.
Students and their supporters were brutalized by the Los Angeles Police Department and arrested. The LAPD issued an arrest to 13
Chicano men for “disturbing the peace” and conspiracy charges. Those arrested were better known to the community as the East
LA 13, and among the youngest was Moctesuma who was only 19 years old at the time.
 Mr. Castro was also among the arrestees
and consequently fired as a result. The decision to fire Mr. Castro was reversed after the community demanded he be reinstated and
occupied  the  school  board  room  until  he  was.  The  political  repression  of  activists  at  this  time  was  part  of  the  systemic  counter
insurgency efforts of law enforcement, most notably, the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) that targeted political
organizations,  surveilled  their  activities,  infiltrated  their  efforts,  and  ultimately  used  that  intelligence  to  incarcerate  an  entire
generation of activists leaders.

The 60s was a crucial time for youth to develop their political identities and exercise their freedom of speech in efforts to change
their schools and society. The walkouts, like other sit-ins and marches of the era, used non-violent resistance to protest systemic
racism. Crucial to creating an alternative educational system as was proposed by the students in their demands and in the aftermath
of the walkouts, was the need for greater control over the decision-making process in schools and the district. While the students
did not achieve all of their demands, they were successful for bringing generations together and laying a foundation to their own
political trajectory.

The Formation of Chicano Studies and Ethnic Studies

During  the  civil  rights  movement,  there  were  many  alternative  models  to  mainstream  education  that  emerged  from  historically
minoritized communities, most prominently within the Black community, from the Citizenship Schools (1945-1965) that were a
response to the racist literacy tests that disenfranchised Black voters to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee’s (SNCC)
Freedom Schools that began in the summer of 1964 to encourage Black Mississippians to think independently and act creatively.
Not  to  mention  in  1969,  the  Black  Panther  Party  (BPP)  launched  Liberation  Schools  that  offered  a  political  education  to  resist
power structures.

Within traditional institutions of higher education, BIPOC as minority groups on college campuses all across the state supported
each  other  and  united  in  their  demands  for  change.  In  the  Bay  Area,  the  Third  World  Liberation  Front  (TWLF),  a  coalition  of
multiracial  and  ethnic  groups  of  students  and  organizations  at  San  Francisco  College  and  University  of  California,  Berkeley,
spearheaded a movement for ethic studies. TWLF specifically employed the term “third world” as a radical identity that positioned

itself  as  anti-imperialist,  anti-colonial,  and  anti-racist.
  From  the  beginning  of  its  formation,  ethnic  studies  recognized  distinct
histories in the U.S., and proposed an internationalist connection of solidarity to liberation struggles in the Global South, in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific Islands. Led by the Black Student Union, the TWLF joined together to form two strikes that
began in 1968 and presented a list of 15 demands, among the list was to create a School of Ethnic Studies. It was in these times that
ethnic  studies  was  defined  as  groups  of  the  Third  World,  Chicano/Latino  studies,  African  American  studies,  Asian  American
studies, and Native American studies. As noted by Ziza Delgado, ethnic studies emerged within a radical political framework that
included elements of culturally relevant education, but were not limited to only the study of culture.

Globally there were revolutionary struggles against colonialism, imperialism, racism, white supremacy, and capitalism. In the midst
of these movements, there was the return of WWII Chicano veterans who gained access to higher education unlike ever before as a
result of the GI Bill and the American GI Forum that ensured veteran rights were respected. These veteran students among others
gave way for the formation and growth of activist student organizations such as United Mexican-American Students (UMAS). The
population  of  students  of  color  at  the  University  of  California,  Santa  Barbara  was  severely  low,  and  there  were  only  about  50
Chicano/Latino students. At UC Santa Barbara, students from UMAS joined in solidarity with the Black Student Union (BSU) and
the  mostly  all-white  Students  for  a  Democratic  Society  (SDS)  under  what  they  called  United  Front  to  take  over  and  occupy  the
University Center. They called for a free-student run university that incorporated instruction on revolutionary movements, global
capitalism, and Marxism.

That same year at UC Santa Barbara, Chicana/os across the states came together under the newly formed Chicano Coordinating
Council on Higher Education to create a blueprint for the formation of Chicano studies. The result was a 155-page manifesto titled,
El Plan de Santa Barbara: A Chicano Plan for Higher Education (“El Plan”) that outlined the three-fold function of the university:
teaching,  research,  and  public  service.
  The  blueprint  opened  with  a  quote  from  Jose  Vasconcelos,  former  Secretary  of  Public
Education of Mexico, that captured the sentiment of the time. “At this moment we do not come to work for the university, but to
demand  that  the  university  work  for  our  people.”  El  Plan  outlined  the  importance  of  the  newly  established  student  support
program,  Educational  Opportunity  Program  (EOP)  and  the  need  for  a  unified  national  student-led  organization,  which  became
Movimiento  Estudiantil  Chicano  Aztlan  (MEChA).  It  called  for  the  formation  of  research  centers  and  the  institutionalization  of
Chicano Studies departments.

While El Plan and the Chicano movement in general were instrumental in paving new directions for the Chicano community, they
were not absolved of critique. In “Sexism in Chicano Studies and the Chicano Community” Cynthia Orozco identifies the sexist
ideologies  that  made  gender  a  secondary  issue  to  race  and  class.
  Orozco  offered  a  sobering  critique  of  Chicano  studies  as  an
academic  discipline,  citing  the  first  edition  of  Rodulfo  Acuña’s  Occupied America  (1972)  and  its  failure  to  incorporate  Chicana
history, leadership, and contributions. Orozco even pointed out how “La Chicana” was a tokenized course, often the only course in
that  interrogated  issues  of  gender,  patriarchy,  and  what  feminists  of  color  at  the  time  articulated  as  “triple  oppression”  and
ultimately  intersectionality.  In  Orozco’s  view,  El  Plan  was  truly  a  “man-ifesto”  that  lacked  a  feminist  vision.  Instead,  Orozco
provides  a  Chicana  feminist  revision  of  El Plan  renaming  it  to,  “El  Plan  de  Santa  y  Barbara”  and  that  parts  with  the  words  of
Señora Josefa Vasconcelos, “At this moment we do not come to work for Chicano studies and the community, but to demand that
Chicano studies and the community work for our liberation too.”  The feminist critiques of El Plan, Chicano studies, the Chicano
movement,  and  the  community  at  large  gave  way  to  Chicana  studies  and  Chicana-led  organizations  (Review  Chapter  5:
Feminisms and Chapter # 7: Social Movement Activity for more on this topic). Similarly, critiques over the lack of an interrogation
of sexuality gave way to Jotería studies (Review Chapter # 6: Jotería Studies). Figure 8.3.1 is from a history and cultural museum in
Los Angeles that featured an exhibit on Chicana women leaders and activists.

By this point, there was not a formalized ethnic studies field, but that’s not to say that the scholarship that emerged from traditional
academic  fields  such  as  sociology,  anthropology,  history,  along  with  other  disciplines  did  not  contribute  to  the  development  of
ethnic studies. We can take for example, Chicana/o historians such as Vicky Ruiz and George Sanchez or Chicana/o sociologists
such as Mary Pardo and Alfredo Mirande who emerged from traditional disciplines, but are regarded as foundational to the field.
Furthermore,  the  role  of  public  intellectuals  outside  of  the  academy  were  instrumental  in  carving  new  trajectories  and  uplifting
political  movements,  such  as  anarchist  journalist  Ricardo  Flores  Magon  and  civil  rights  activist  Adela  Sloss  Vento.  From  the
beginning, ethnic studies redefined traditional notions of scholarship, intellectualism, and what we consider to be texts. The work
of these scholars built a foundation for future generations of BIPOC scholars to build upon.

Unlike all other academic disciplines, Chicano studies, like ethnic studies, is more than just an academic discipline. Ethnic studies
is a political project born out of struggle and critique of the institution it emerges within and education in general. It was not meant
to conform to the status quo of these institutions, rather to serve as a powerhouse of change. From the beginning, ethnic studies was
a community-driven project. And unlike other academic disciplines that make claims of objectivity and to present in unbiased or
impartial ways, ethnic studies stands firmly against oppression of any form. Paulo Freire in The Politics of Education (1985) wrote
about the impossibility of neutrality in the face of oppression stating, “Washing one’s hands of the conflict between the powerful
and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral.”  Ethnic studies does not only study oppression, it directly
engages with struggles for liberation that go beyond education.

The Backlash and Disinvestment in Public Education

As urban schools and cities experienced the changes of deindustrialization and disinvestment, the racialization of the welfare state
through  popular  cultural  deprivation  theories  continued  to  gain  traction.  Ronald  Reagan’s  deployment  of  the  racialized  and
gendered trope of the so-called “welfare queen” throughout his 1976 presidential campaign trail demonstrated the growing binary
of white “taxpayer” versus Black “tax-recipient.” Martha Escobar argues that the perceived threat of Black mothers as “breeders”
of deviancy, criminality, and poverty is transposed onto Latina mothers, immigrant Latina mothers especially, who are viewed as
unworthy and undeserving of social welfare services, including health and education.
 This growing fear over financing of Black
and Latinx communities, along with the economic insecurities fueled the racialized tax revolts of the late 70s and 80s.

This  white  backlash  enabled  Caifornia  laws  such  as  Proposition  13  to  pass,  signaling  a  critical  turning  point  for  the  finance  of
public education.
 Prior to 1978, public schools collected as much funding as was needed from local property taxes. This meant
that neighborhoods with higher property taxes could collect more money for per pupil spending. Prop 13 set a 1% property tax limit
across the state, where the assessed value could not grow more than 2% a year. The state, however, was either not financially able
or willing to supply the needed local financing of schools that was not supplied through local property taxes. As a consequence, the
most  impacted  were  school  budgets  that  cut  nurses,  counselors,  librarians,  vocational  education,  music  and  art  programs,  adult
education, summer and after-school programming, and anything viewed as excess to the core academic curriculum such as elective
courses.

 Sidebar

In 1965, California had one of the highest rates of per-pupil spending in the U.S. Today, it is one of the lowest. This is the
legacy of Prop 13. How much wealthier are white school districts in comparison to nonwhite ones? $23 billion.

The  disinvestment  in  public  education  fueled  by  the  racialized  tax  revolts  of  the  late  70s  and  80s  made  school  districts  heavily
dependent on state budgets. These changes came at a time when civil rights victories fought to desegregate schools and students of
color were redefining the role of education. In the 70s, desegregation efforts were often circumvented, like the case in Houston,
Texas,  when  a  school  district  claimed  their  district  integrated  Mexican  “white”  students  with  Black  students,  maintaining  white
  In  other  cases,  white  families  fled  to  surrounding  suburbs  with  LAUSD  experiencing  a  drop  of  20,000  white
schools intact.
 This was part of the larger pattern of white flight in cities such as Los Angeles
students after busing programs were introduced.
as suburbanization gave white families an opportunity to sell their home, maintain their wealth, and escape into the suburbs.

This issues have spurred activist responses. Figure 8.3.2 demonstrates critiques of criminalization and incarceration as responses to
social problems.  The poster reads, “Building strong communities not prisons and jails! The prison crisis in California is not over.
People are organizing and fighting back!” Californians United for a Responsible Budget (CURB) is a broad-based coalition of over
70  organizations  seeking  to  CURB  prison  spending  by  reducing  the  number  of  people  in  prison  and  the  number  of  prisons  in
California.  Similarly,  Figure  8.3.3  is  a  2008  poster  that  reads,  “Abolish  the  prison  industrial  complex.  Missing:  2.3  million
Americans from their family, friends, and community.”

## 8.4: When Ganas is not Enough, 1976-2000

Public Schools as Scapegoats

By  the  1980s,  an  era  obsessed  with  academic  “excellence”  was  introduced.  This  was  evidenced  in  the  report  A  Nation  at  Risk
(1983), which cautioned over a “rising tide in mediocrity” and sustained a discourse that advocated for higher standards in public
schools. It is no coincidence that this report emerged at a time when the rise in foreign-born populations from Latin America and
Asia gave rise to xenophobic fears and an English Only movement. At the center of these debates was the Plyler  v.  Doe (1975)
Supreme  Court  case  filed  by  the  Mexican  American  Legal  Defense  Fund  (MALDEF).  Decided  in  1983,  it  involved  the  state  of
Texas changing an Education Code to allow schools to withhold admission or charged tuition to undocumented children. The court
ruled that every young person, regardless of their immigration status, has a right to attend a free public school in grades K-12. This
historic  case  was  essential  for  combating  early  efforts  to  create  a  school-to-deportation  pipeline,  that  is,  school  policies  and
practices that effectuate the removal of undocumented immigrant youth from schools and ultimately the U.S.

While the removal of undocumented immigrant children in schools remained unsuccessful, language in schools continued to be a
political battleground that enabled the continuance of segregation and Americanization efforts previously employed to discriminate
and  exclude  non-native  English  speakers,  including  Latinx  children.  In  1986,  Proposition  63  passed,  which  made  English  the
official  language  of  California. The  xenophobic  fears  of  the  time  were  among  many  other  social  fears  attached  to  crime  and
poverty that targeted the most vulnerable student populations in our schools.

Mr. Escalante’s Math Enrichment Program

Mainstream  portrayals  of  urban  schools  as  pathological,  deficient,  decaying,  and  failing  were  captured  through  popular  media
productions such as the iconic films, Stand and Deliver (1988) and Lean on Me (1989), which were both based on true stories. For
example, Stand and Deliver focuses on Bolivian American math teacher, Jaime Escalante, from Garfield High School in East Los
Angeles, who raised expectations and instilled the ganas (spirit of motivation, willpower, grit, and resilience) in his students.
 The
film credits his ethic of care and strict pedagogy to the success of 18 of his students who passed their AP Calculus exams in 1982.
The Educational Testing Service accused the students of cheating, made them retake the exam, and when they did they passed with
even higher scores, and proved to the nation that inner city kids were teachable. While the film sheds light on the importance of
educators  that  extend  an  ethic  of  care  to  their  students,  the  truth  is  these  students  were  successful  because  they  had  years  of
preparation and support.

The failure of Hollywood films such as these are that they do not give credit to the real source of student success. Escalante, with
the support of his principal, built a math enrichment program that partnered with local feeder schools to replace basic math with
algebra, giving students the opportunity to enter high school on a higher level of math. The program also partnered with the local
community  college  to  provide  a  7-week  intense  math  training  course  in  the  summer,  allowing  students  to  either  get  ahead  or
practice their skills.
 Escalante practiced an open enrollment policy for his classes, meaning anyone who was interested could take
his classes, as he did not approve of gifted, honors, tracking, or the need for qualifying exams to prove they were ready. “The only
thing you need to have for my program––and you must bring it every day ––is ganas.”  The program also ensured students were
provided  with  tutoring  before  and  after  school,  and  even  offered  paid  opportunities  for  previous  students  to  provide  tutoring.
Essentially, Escalante’s students were successful because he disrupted the status quo, created a new academic pipeline in math, and
provided the support students needed to succeed.

Stand  and  Deliver,  like  many  films  of  the  time,  does  not  accurately  show  why  students  were  successful  and  instead  credited  a
tough, punitive approach to schooling. Mr. Escalante knew that students needed more than ganas to succeed academically, hence he
went  beyond  his  role  in  the  classroom  to  create  educational  opportunities  that  would  have  been  absent  otherwise.  In  an  under-
resourced school such as Garfield High School, Escalante went out of his way to create a pipeline of hope for student’s to succeed.

Films such as Stand and Deliver and Lean on Me gave mainstream audiences a glimpse into “urban schools” for the first time, or
perhaps more correctly, schools where the majority of the student demographic was of color. The dominant narrative was that
these  urban  schools  were  failing  because  they  were  ungovernable  and  out  of  control,  not  because  they  were  overcrowded,
inadequately resourced, and segregated. Change for these schools was only possible with the presence of an unrelenting patriarchal
figure, whether it was Mr. Escalante’s unwillingness to give up on his students or the more punitive approach depicted in the film
Lean on Me where the new principal, Mr. Clark, infamously expelled hundreds of “troublemakers” in a school assembly for their
misconduct. After doing so Mr. Clark declares to the rest of the student body, “My motto is simple. If you do not succeed in life, I
do  not  want  you  to  blame  your  parents.  I  don’t  want  you  to  blame  the  white  man.  I  want  you  to  blame  yourselves.  The

responsibility  is  yours.”   The  bootstraps  narrative  captured  in  this  statement,  that  is,  the  idea  that  educational  success  is
attainable through personal initiative, hard work, responsibility, and drive, is a common narrative in schools. Students are expected
to beat the institutional odds set up against them as if individual effort was all that was necessary to overcome them.

Moreover, films of this time served to fuel the media hysteria over violent youth perceived as “super-predators” and implement
zero tolerance policies, that is, punitive school measures that push out “problem students” through practices such as expulsion and
suspension  regardless  of  the  severity  of  a  student’s  behavior.  In  the  next  decades,  these  types  of  practices  and  policies  would
become  the  norm  for  inner  city  schools,  coalescing  with  what  scholars  identify  as  the  school-to-prison  pipeline––the  school
practices and policies that disproportionately place students of color into the juvenile and adult criminal justice system. The most
under-resourced schools have the most resources funneled into creating prison-like school environments by implementing random
locker  and  person  searches,  metal  detectors,  security  cameras,  security  guards,  and  police  presence.  The  disinvestment  in  the
quality  of  life  and  educational  opportunities  for  children  of  color  in  poverty,  with  the  investment  in  the  criminalization  and
surveillance efforts both in and out of school, effectively strengthen a pipeline from schools to prisons.

 Sidebar

Latinx and Black youth are the most impacted by zero-tolerance policies and practices, accounting for the majority of school
suspension and expulsion rates.

 Pause and Reflect

In your opinion, what can schools do better or differently to challenge the school-to-prison pipeline?

The Latinx Threat in Schools

By the 1990s, it was clear that future immigrants were not coming from European countries nor were they Anglo-Protestants. The
demographic changes were of concern to many political and academic conservatives who cautioned that future immigrants would
 In fact,
be from Spanish-speaking countries, immigrants that once they arrived did not assimilate to American culture and life.
demographers predicted that by 2025, Latinos would become the largest ethnic group in California. These concerns coincided with
the  economic  recession  in  the  early  1990s  and  growing  civil  unrest  evidenced  by  the  Los  Angeles  Rebellion  of  1992.  In
communities  with  an  absence  of  a  large  white  population,  narratives  of  racial  conflict  among  children  of  immigrants  and  more
established populations were repeatedly portrayed in the media. Most notably, Fox News coverage on what was commonly referred
to as “Black and Mexican conflict” in schools. These type of stories sensationalized racial conflict and tension, grew concerns over
crime and violence, and emerged at a time when California relied on undocumented immigrants as a scapegoat to be blamed.

 Theory Spotlight: Leo Chavez's The Latino Threat Narrative

The xenophobic concerns of the time are best summarized by Latino anthropologist, Leo Chavez, in what he identifies as the
Latino threat narrative––a dominant narrative reproduced in society:

1. Latinos are a reproductive threat, altering the demographic makeup of the nation.

2. Latinos are unable or unwilling to learn English.

3. Latinos are unable or unwilling to integrate into the larger society; they live apart from the larger society, not integrating

socially.

4. Latinos  are  unchanging  and  immutable;  they  are  not  subject  to  history  and  transforming  social  forces  around  them;  they

reproduce their own cultural world.

5. Latinos,  especially  Americans  of  Mexican  origin,  are  part  of  a  conspiracy  to  reconquer  the  southwestern  United  States,

returning the land to Mexico’s control. This is why they remain apart and unintegrated in the larger society.

While there are many ways in which the narratives that Latinxs are a threat to society manifest, in California, there were two key
propositions  that  captured  how  education  became  a  site  for  policy  makers  to  ease  xenophobic  fears,  Proposition  187  and
Proposition 227.

Proposition 187

In 1994, Proposition 187 was an initiative that, as its title indicated, attempted to “Save Our State.” The title alone invoked the idea
that  in  the  public’s  imagination,  California  was  a  non-immigrant  state  that  needed  to  be  saved  from  undocumented  immigrants,
commonly  racialized  as  “illegal  aliens.”  Governor  Wilson  made  undocumented  immigrants  the  focus  of  his  political  re-election
campaign,  endorsing  Prop  187  and  advertising  a  commercial  that  depicted  undocumented  immigrants  running  across  the  border
from Mexico, warning viewers, “They keep coming. Two million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won’t
stop them at the border, yet requires us to pay billions to take care of them.”  The  proposition  was  passed  with  nearly  59%  of
voters  approving  the  creation  of  a  state-run  citizenship  screening  system  meant  to  deny  undocumented  immigrants  state  public
social  services,  including  access  to  public  education  and  non-emergency  health  care.  Moreover,  the  proposition  would  have
deputized  anyone  that  served  or  assisted  an  undocumented  immigrant,  including  teachers  and  doctors.  Essentially,  employees  of
schools  and  hospitals  would  operate  as  immigration  enforcement  officers.  It  was  estimated  that  300,000  undocumented  children
were to be denied public education if enacted. However, the proposition was never enacted due to the successful legal challenge by
MALDEF, ACLU, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), and AAAJ (Asian Americans Advancing
Justice), among others, that argued it was unconstitutional and violated Plyler v. Doe.

 Film Spotlight: Fear and Learning at Hoover Elementary (1997)

The 1997 film, Fear and Learning at Hoover Elementary, directed by teacher-turned-filmmaker Laura Simons, takes us into
Hoover Street Elementary to expose how Proposition 187 directly impacted the lives of students in one of the most diverse
areas of Los Angeles.

The fight against Prop 187 was a true testament of communities rising up in solidarity. As African American high school student
Annette  Wells,  co-founder  of  South  Central  Youth  Empowered  Thru  Action  (SCYEA),  shouted  to  a  crowd  of  70,000  in  Los
Angeles, “This racist unjust government that we live in, finds some way to break us down. We need to join together in unity. It is
about time we have peace within our community. Join us! Join us! We need to fight for voter education. Fight for voter registration,
orale!”  On November 2, only days before election day, over 10,000 youth across the state walked out in opposition to Prop 187.
College students and labor unions, all united against the proposition. There was a strong presence and organized effort from Asian,
Black,  and  white  communities.  The  opposition  to  Prop  187  served  to  increase  voter  turnout  among  the  Latinx  community  and
created a generation of activists.

and the second in Los Angeles.

Proposition 227

Furthermore, xenophobic fears gave way for Califonia voters to approve the 1998 Proposition 227, “English Language in Public
Schools,”  which  effectively  eliminated  bilingual  education  in  public  schools  and  weakened  language  equity  gains  of  the  1970s.
Specifically, in regard to the Supreme Court decision in Lau vs. Nichols (1974) in which Chinese parents in San Francisco Unified
School District filed a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit emerged when Chinese, Filipino, and Latina/o children failed in school due
to  not  being  able  to  understand  the  lessons  in  English.  The  families  essentially  argued  for  language  equity,  that  is,  a  bilingual
curriculum that allowed students to comprehend and succeed. The school district counter-argued that all students were offered the
same curriculum, therefore, it offered an equal education. In other words, the district asserted that offering a distinct curriculum
was discriminatory as it catered to students based on their national-origin. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the parents citing
that  the  district  was  in  violation  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  (Title  IV),  which  meant  that  schools  were  required  to  create  a  distinct
curriculum  that  catered  to  English  language  learners,  essentially  supporting  bilingual  education.  Figure  8.4.3  illustrates  the
difference between equality and equity. As the image states, “1. Equality: is giving people the same thing/s. 2. Equity: is fairness in
every situation.”

Figure 8.4.3: “#equality but I still don't know what banks mean by #equity” by Leigh Blackall, Flickr is licensed CC BY 2.0.

The  ruling  in  Lau  vs.  Nichols  is  an  example  of  why  there  needs  to  be  a  differentiation  of  equality  versus  equity  in  education.
Whereas  equality  means  that  each  individual  or  group  of  people  are  given  the  exact  same  resources  and  opportunities,  equity
recognizes  that  equal  outcomes  cannot  be  produced  without  catering  to  the  specific  needs.  In  this  case,  bilingual  education  was
meant to address a specific need for English language learners to master the English language while retaining their native language.

However,  not  everyone  viewed  bilingual  education  as  a  way  for  students  to  succeed  academically.  After  Jaime  Escalante
successfully eliminated most of Garfield High School’s bilingual education classes because he believed they held students back, he
served as Honorary Chairperson of the “English for the Children” campaign that sponsored Prop 227. By this time, Escalante was
the  most  prominent  Latino  teacher  in  the  state  due  to  the  appraisal  of  the  film  Stand  and  Deliver (1988).  Escalante,  like  many
supporters  of  Prop  227,  argued  that  since  language  immersion  programs  would  not  exceed  one  year,  students  would  master  the
English language faster.

However,  opponents  argued  that  Prop  227  destroys  local  control  over  language  instruction  for  English  language  learners  and
effectively  positions  students  to  fail  as  they  are  fast-tracked  to  learn  English  in  one  year  before  transitioning  to  English-only
classrooms. Fernando Alberto, a senior at Roosevelt High School who walked out with thousands of students across the state to
protest the approval of the proposition, expressed the same sentiment exclaiming, “I don’t know where I would be if I didn’t have
those classes,” referring to the bilingual classes he was placed in after emigrating from Honduras. “It’s ridiculous for them to think
everyone is going to make it in just one year.”

Generations of students were severely impacted by the aftermath of Prop 227. Not until 2016, did 73% of voters overturn the
almost 20 year ban on bilingual instruction with Proposition 58. Today, research demonstrates that students in dual-language
immersion and bilingual education students outperform traditional English-only students. California accounts for 60% of dual
language programs in the U.S.

Proposition 209

The  90s  was  an  era  that  blatantly  attacked  the  Latinx  community,  whether  it  was  efforts  to  deny  undocumented  students  from
receiving  a  public  education  or  eliminate  bilingual  education  altogether.  In  this  era,  Californian’s  also  witnessed  institutions  of
higher education impacted by the Proposition 209 “California Civil Rights Initiative” (1996), which prohibits affirmative action, or
granting  preferential  treatment  based  on  race,  sex,  color,  ethnicity  or  national  origin  in  operating  public  employment,  public
education, or public contracting.

Affirmative action programs were essential for providing equal opportunity and diversifying colleges and universities in regard to
hiring of faculty and staff, but also admissions of students. This is particularly important for underrepresented Latinx and Black
students who have the lowest number of enrollment in colleges and universities. In fact, the backlash with affirmative action was a
direct result of a civil rights gain in the the Supreme Court ruling of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which ruled in
favor of university affirmative action programs, deciding that race can be one of several factors in admissions policies, but not the
use of quotas. In that case, Allan Bakke was a 35-year-old white male who was denied admissions twice to the UC Davis Medical
School. Bakke claimed that the special admissions reserved for minority groups excluded him based on his race. Essentially, Bakke
made  claims  of  reverse  discrimination,  that  is,  when  members  of  dominant  or  privileged  groups  make  claims  of  discrimination
based on the rights (or in this case access) given to historically minoritized groups. Bakke claimed to be a victim of affirmative
action programs designed to level the playing field for minoritized groups. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of affirmative action,
but would set the waves of backlash that culminated with Prop 209.

 Pause and Reflect

In  2020,  Proposition  16  was  placed  on  the  ballot  to  repeal  Proposition  209,  but  Californian  voted  against  it.  Do  you  think
affirmative action programs are necessary today to provide equal opportunity in employment and education?

Starving For Justice

In  the  90s,  university  campuses  in  California  were  called  into  question  by  the  courageous  leadership  of  BIPOC  students  who
employed hunger strikes, literally starvation and the risk of death, as a political tactic to create social and institutional change. The
hunger strikes, though not in unison or at all at once, emerged at a time when all universities experienced severe budget cuts and
fee hikes, making it more challenging for BIPOC to gain access to the university and for programs such as ethnic studies to be
sustained.  Chicana/o  Studies  professor  Ralph  Armbruster-Sandoval’s  book,  Starving  for  Justice  (2017)  provides  an  in-depth
documentation of three hunger strikes led by students at UC Los Angeles (May 24-June 7, 1993), UC Santa Barbara (April 27-May

5, 1994), and Stanford University (May 4 - 6, 1994).
administrators to implement their demands for change.

 Certainly the hunger strikes were a last resort to further pressure university

In the 1990s, nearly every university campus engaged in countless protests against higher fees, budget cuts, and the university’s
failure  to  invest  in  BIPOC  recruitment  and  retention  of  both  faculty  and  students.  At  UCSB,  for  example,  students  went  on  a
hunger strike in 1989 and when the demands were left unmet, hunger striked again in 1994. While there were many similarities
across the hunger strikes, each campus has their unique history, struggles, and set of demands. It is important to note that while the
establishment and expansion of ethnic studies departments was a central concern across all of the hunger strikes, it was not the only
one. In reference to the hunger strikes at UCLA, UCSB, and Stanford, professor of Chican/o studies, Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval
notes, “Chicana/o studies was critical, but so were obtaining better wages and working conditions for farm workers; creating safe
spaces  where  students  and  low-income  immigrant  families  could  organize  and  mobilize  to  stop  budget  cuts,  deportations,  and
unscrupulous landlords; lowering student fees; and establishing a more diverse student body and faculty.”

The  strength  in  student  power  was  effective  because  multiracial/ethnic  coalitions  were  formed  across  student  organizations.
Students were supported by faculty who were actively engaged in the strikes, risking their own positions in doing so. The hunger
strikes  were  effective  across  all  of  the  universities  in  getting  the  administration’s  attention  and  their  commitment  to  implement
changes. While each campus created their distinct set of demands, the self-sacrifice of hunger strikers and the communities that
supported them halted the systemic demise of ethnic studies, paved the way for the university to commit to hire more faculty of
color, and institutionalized the financial support for the recruitment efforts of students of color. The image in Figure 8.4.4 depicts
the Third World Liberation Front 2016 hunger strikers at San Francisco State College.

Why do you think students historically and today continue to take such drastic measures such as a hunger strike to enact social
and institutional change?

## 8.5: Aquí Estamos y No Nos Vamos, 2001-2012

No Child Left Behind

In 2002, Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), a reauthorization of
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, a cornerstone of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration’s efforts to
carry the “War on Poverty” efforts, but this time through education. Essentially, the ESEA allows states to manage federal funds in
an effort to provide an equal quality education to children in poverty. While NCLB was not the first reauthorization of the ESEA, it
was different.

NCLB was a law that introduced an era of standardization and accountability in K-12 education unlike ever before. The act made
the  federal  government’s  role  in  education  greater  than  ever,  while  allowing  for  schools  to  have  local  control  and  for  parents  to
exercise  school  choice.  Each  public  school  entity  was  required  to  show  adequate  yearly  progress  (AYP)  based  on  state-set
standardized  tests,  with  the  goal  that  by  2014,  all  schools  and  its  students  were  expected  to  perform  at  grade-level.  The  law
provided federal financial support to under-resourced schools or schools classified as Title I, schools with high numbers or high
percentages of low-income families, in exchange for greater accountability. In essence, the schools with the most need would get
greater assistance, and all schools were expected to demonstrate AYP.

It did not take long for the results of NCLB to confirm what many critics cautioned, which is that NCLB’s unrealistic expectations
will set up schools and school districts that serve historically marginalized communities to fail. In fact, a 2006 study revealed that
schools  that  did  not  meet  AYP  in  California  and  Illinois  served  75-85%  minority  students,  meanwhile  schools  that  met  AYP
enrolled  less  than  40%  minority  students.
  Furthermore,  critics  stressed  that  state  defined  academic  content  standards  and
predefined achievement standards in reading/language arts and math left behind the most marginalized students, such as students
with  learning  disabilities  and  English  language  learners,  who  were  expected  to  perform  at  the  same  level  of  “proficiency”
predetermined by the state.

The NCLB Act greatly impacted entire school cultures and school communities as they were essentially punished when they did
not improve their academic performance on standardized tests. Lower performing schools prioritized teaching to the test, often with
scripted lessons, and made subjects like art and history secondary as students were not tested in them.
 As a high school student in
the city of Compton during this time, I recall our principal bringing a few of the AP and honors courses together to teach us how to
take a test. I was blown away at how I could answer test questions for the language arts portion without actually reading the literary
passage.  The  strategies  he  taught  us  had  nothing  to  do  with  reading  comprehension  and  more  to  do  with  test-taking  skills.  Our
principal  was  willing  to  do  what  it  took  to  excite  students  about  the  yearly  testing  season.  He  often  rode  a  bicycle  around  the
campus with a bubble machine to remind us, “Make sure to fill in all of the bubbles” on the test. We had pizza parties and jumpers
after a long morning of testing to incentivize and reward students for attending school. While at the time I did not understand the
repercussions for attending a school deemed as “failing” and “in need of improvement,” I knew that we had lost our accreditation
and with it, most of our student population. These are the stories of many school communities across the U.S.

NCLB introduced an era of accountability that consequently fueled the push out of students, teachers, and in some cases, enabled
the closure of public schools. What a narrow focus on standardized test outputs revealed was that the achievement gap is truly an
opportunity gap that extends beyond the scope of increasing federal funds in schools. The opportunity gap refers to life chances
that are determined by the lack of opportunities, which are inherently influenced by factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and ZIP code, among other social and structural conditions that prevent student readiness and better educational outcomes.
None  of  these  factors  should  matter,  but  they  do.  There  will  always  be  success  stories  of  individual  students  that  beat  the  odds,
educators  that  go  above  and  beyond,  parents  that  become  fierce  advocates,  community  leaders  that  pose  creative  solutions,  but
these stories are not the norm for most students.

Militarization of Schools

A  provision  of  the  NCLB  act  was  for  military  recruiters  to  have  access  to  school  facilities  and,  upon  request,  the  contact
information of each student. In other words, schools that did not comply with this provision of the federal law jeopardize receiving
federal aid. Parents were given the option to opt their children out. This provision was highly criticized by students and parents
alike. It opened up the question: does a military presence belong in schools? Military recruiters on school campuses are known to
establish rapport with students, often serving as coaches, substitutes, and filling in where needed. Military recruitment takes place
through class presentations, lunch time, and some campuses even provide a permanent office space for military recruiters to meet
with students. Writing on a campaign to remove a military recruiter, Roberto Camacho summarizes:

In  2018,  Truth  In  Recruitment  helped  spearhead  a  movement  to  remove  a  noncommissioned  California  National  Guard
recruiter who actually had an office on Santa Maria High School’s campus. Although the recruiter was officially listed as a
“volunteer”  who  was  supposed  to  facilitate  an  anti-bullying  and  holistic  “rehabilitation”  program,  the  office  essentially
served as a de facto recruitment center. Literature, pamphlets, and banners for the California National Guard were plastered
both inside and outside of the recruiter’s office. A California Public Records Act request revealed that school policy dictated
that  volunteers  could  not  use  campus  space  to  promote  another  business,  and  the  recruiter  was  eventually  removed.  The
school’s principal, however, was not happy and subsequently banned Truth in Recruitment from participating in career day
events or giving presentations to students on campus.

Educational campaigns such as those brought forth by Truth In Recruitment in Santa Maria are necessary for school communities
to be self-determined in creating learning environments that reflect how they wish to experience their schools.

Many critics of military recruiters in working-class schools state that they exploit the financial and social insecurity of working-
class students with the promise of a career through the military and scholarships for college. There are also issues over students’
privacy and whether the military should have access to all of a students’ contact information, especially in cases where students
experience heightened military recruitment but insufficient college recruitment.

The provision in the law sparked controversy, especially because it emerged after 9/11 and the U.S. invasion of Iraq, giving way to
an anti-war movement. The anti-war sentiment was strong among Santa Cruz High School students, who, at the height of the war,
300-500 students participated in a walkout in protest. This is why it was no surprise when in 2003, Santa Cruz high school students
launched a campaign to adopt an opt-in policy.
 There were concerns that parents are often unaware that their child’s information
was automatically shared with military recruiters. Rather than leaving the burden of opting out to parents, parents now had to opt-in
to have their child’s information shared with military recruiters. The successful campaigning of students led to the district adopting
this change, however, it never took effect as that summer the Department of Education and Department of Defense joined in a letter
to inform all school superintendents that the “opt-in” policy is in violation of the NCLB law.

The  promises  offered  by  military  recruiters  is  very  enticing  for  youth  who  are  uncertain  about  their  future  after  high  school.
Undocumented youth, for example, are encouraged to enlist with the promise of citizenship, even though the military does not and
cannot grant citizenship to its undocumented members. In fact, to enlist one needs to be a permanent resident (“green card” holder).
There are, on average, 8,000 permanent residents that enlist annually. Enlisting does not guarantee a pathway to citizenship, but the
military can assist its members with completing paperwork to effectuate the process. At a time when undocumented students are
presented with the challenge of college affordability and access, enlisting in the military may present itself as more promising and
realistic. Figure 8.5.1 displays an activist poster that reads, “Defund militarism. Reclaim our resources.” It was produced in 2020 as
part  of  the  De-mil-i-ta-rise  movement  to  reclaim  resources  from  the  war  industry,  reinvest  in  life-giving  institutions,  and  repair
collaborative relationships with the earth and people around the world..

 Sidebar

The  presence  of  military  recruiters  is  only  one  of  the  ways  schools  have  become  more  militarized.  Today,  the  rise  of  gun
violence in schools has opened up the conversation on whether a stronger police presence in school is needed and some have
even called for the arming of teachers and staff with guns.

 Pause and Reflect

What is your opinion on military recruitment in schools and the overall militarization of schools? How do we increase campus
safety?

Undocumented and Unafraid

In  2001,  the  first  version  of  the  Development,  Relief,  and  Education  for  Alien  Minors  (DREAM)  Act  was  first  introduced  to
Congress. In short, the DREAM Act is targeted to protect current, future, and former undocumented high school graduates or GED
recipients  who  emigrated  to  the  U.S.  as  children  by  providing  them  a  pathway  to  citizenship  through  college,  work,  or  military
service.  For  the  past  two  decades,  there  have  been  over  10  versions  of  this  act  proposed,  each  time  failing  to  garner  sufficient
Congressional votes to pass. In consequence, the undocumented population of over 2 million that is eligible is left deportable.

Annually, households that include Dreamers generate $15.5 billion in federal taxes and $8.5 billion in state and local taxes, and

tuition at public colleges and universities. Since then, there have been other bills passed (AB 2000 and SB 68) that expand the
scope  of  undocumented  students  eligible  for  in-state  tuition  in  spite  of  not  having  resident  status.  While  paying  for  in-state
tuition is a great first step, it is not enough for undocumented students if they are ineligible for financial aid to assist them in
paying for a higher education. In 2011, AB 130 and AB 131 were signed allowing for undocumented students designated under
AB 540/AB 2000 to apply for state financial aid and state funded scholarships under the California Dream Act Application
(CADAA).  These  reforms  are  critical  as  they  allow  for  undocumented  students  financial  need  to  be  served  and  for  them  to
have a sense of belonging.

 Sidebar

Approximately 98,000 undocumented students graduate from U.S. high schools every year. 27,000 of those students graduate
from California’s high schools.

None  of  these  reforms  would  be  possible  without  the  social  unrest  of  undocumented  students  who  have  led  and  provided  new
directions to the (im)migrant rights movement, engaged in acts of civil disobedience, and risked arrest, detention, and deportation.
Early  on,  the  term  “DREAM-er”  was  employed  by  undocumented  student  activists,  also  referred  to  as  the  1.5  generation  who
emigrated to the U.S. as children. This generation identifies as American, attended and graduated from American schools, and yet
are faced with institutional barriers that serve as reminders that they do not belong. Video 8.5.1 provides a glimpse into the work of
Julio Salgado, an undocumented and queer (undocuqueer) activist who continues to play a pivotal role in the immigration rights
movement.

The  creative  genius  of  the  undocumented  student  activist  community  was  instrumental  in  creating  awareness  and  mobilizing
support to create change. Students wore caps and gowns and performed mock graduation ceremonies as tactics to raise awareness
and  redefine  negative  images  of  undocumented  immigrants  that  depict  them  as  criminals  and  unassimilated.  Immigrant  youth
boldly affirmed they were “coming out of the shadows” and proclaiming themselves as “undocumented and unafraid.” The courage
of undocumented student activists encouraged others to do the same, especially those who grew up with the understanding that no
one should ever know your unauthorized immigration status. Students continue to lead reforms, such as the student organization
Students for Quality Education (SQE), the signing of AB 21 in 2017, a bill to protect the information of undocumented students on
CSU campuses, and to create a protocol in the event that federal immigration enforcement enters the campus.

Many colleges and universities now have a Dream Center, annual undocumented student programming, and undocumented student
organizations. In spite of the gains, the fear of detention and deportation continues to be a possible reality for “DREAM-ers” and
their  families  as  none  of  the  reforms  mentioned  enable  a  pathway  to  U.S.  citizenship,  permanent  residency,  nor  do  they  assist
undocumented immigrant populations that entered the U.S. as adults.

Walkouts Against HR 4437

(cid:0) Content Warning: Self-Harm. Please note that this section includes discussion of self-harm.

The “Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act” (HR 4437) passed the House of Representatives in
December 2005 and if signed into law, it would have criminalized any undocumented immigrant without authorization to be in the
U.S.. making it a felony charge. Returning from winter break, students across schools and universities expressed their opposition
and organized through MySpace, text messaging, chat rooms, and email. What we collectively witnessed were nation-wide youth
walkouts in hundreds of schools.

Unlike  the  East  LA  walkouts  of  1968,  the  students  who  walked  out  in  2006  were  not  organizing  to  reform  their  schools  from
within, but to change society. Wayne Yang observed that in the Bay area, “There was no clear single leader in the student strikes,
nor was there a vanguard youth organization.”  This was true across many schools and is testament to the role that social media
began to play in grassroots, organic, bottom-up youth organizing––a fast type of organizing that did not require political leadership
or  formal  organizations.  This  is  not  to  say  that  some  schools  did  not  have  leadership,  or  that  leaders  did  not  emerge  from  the
organizing.

Similar to the 1968 East LA walkouts, students were quickly reprimanded by administrators and threatened with suspension and
lock downs to prevent them from walking out. At DeAnza Middle School, eight-grade student Anthony Soltero was punished for
walking out by his Vice Principal, only to commit suicide later that day. As reported, the Vice Principal “terrorized” Anthony with
threats  of  three  years  of  prison  time,  forbade  him  from  attending  his  8th  grade  graduation  ceremony,  and  mentioned  truancy
penalties his parents would have to pay for walking out.
 Anthony was already on probation for a previous offense (bringing a pen
knife to school). The punitive approach taken by an administrator added unnecessary pressure to a child who was in the beginning
stages of developing their own political consciousness and becoming civically engaged. It was not uncommon for students to be
threatened  with  losing  their  scholarships  or  not  being  able  to  participate  in  graduation  ceremonies  to  prevent  the  walkouts  from
continuing. Afterall, schools lose per-pupil funding when a student is marked absent and are therefore incentivized to keep students
in  schools.  Figure  8.5.2  depicts  people  holding  signs  that  honor  and  commemorate  the  life  of  Anthony  Soltero  during  an  anti-
HR4437 demonstration, clearly conveying that these two events are connected.

What the country collectively witnessed in the spring of 2006, were a series of school walkouts to collectively express opposition
to HR 4437 and support for comprehensive immigration reform and amnesty. Aquí estamos y no nos vamos (Here we are and we
are  not  leaving)  was  a  rallying  cry  across  nationwide  demonstrations.  Students  engaged  in  walkouts,  teach-ins,  and  collaborated
with other youth across schools and districts. Entire families participated in marches such as “A Day Without Immigrants” or The
Great American Boycott, that promoted “no work, no school, no shopping” for society and industries to recognize the economic
value of immigrant labor and their contributions to society. In downtown LA, we witnessed the mega-marches unlike ever before.
Many  proclaimed  that  the  “sleeping  giant”  was  finally  awakened.  The  mass  mobilization  efforts  against  HR  4437  effectively
prevented  it  from  becoming  law  and  an  entire  generation  of  students  learned  the  collective  power  they  have  when  they  unite  in
defense of their communities.

Somos Semillas: Re-Igniting an Ethnic Studies Movement

In 2006, Dolores Huerta was invited to deliver a talk to students at Tucson Magnet High School after the nation-wide walkouts
against HR4437. Upon the request of school administrators, Huerta encouraged students to explore alternate ways to create social
change, such as to identify and write to their Congressional representatives and question them on why “Republicans hate Latinos.”
Afterall, the anti-immigrant bills were spearheaded by the Republican party. She motivated students to continue their engagement
in  activism  by  exploring  other  forms  of  political  power.  This  remark  set  off  a  wave  of  backlash  by  conservative  Republican
legislators, including Arizona’s Superintendent of Instruction of the time, Tom Horne who began probing into the school.

In  “An  Open  Letter  to  the  Citizens  of  Tucson”  released  in  2007,  Horne  began  to  make  his  case  against  the  Mexican  American
Studies (MAS) program, MEChA, ethnic studies textbooks, and made a call to action for citizens to pressure the Tucson Unified
School District (TUSD) to terminate ethnic studies.
 Horne’s initial strategy of mobilizing community members against the school
was  ineffective,  and  on  the  contrary,  the  entire  school  community  along  with  other  supporters,  unified  to  defend  what  rapidly
became an attack against ethnic studies in general. Horne, along with other key players, were able to get a newly elected Latino
Republican state legislator, Steve Montenegro, who emigrated from El Salvador as a child, to sponsor the House Bill (HB) 2281
(2010), a revision to statute 15-112(A), which effectively sought to terminate ethnic studies.

In spring of 2010, the MAS program effectively became the target of HB 2281, which prohibited a school district or charter school
from including in its program of instruction any courses or classes that:

1. Promote the overthrow of the United States government.
2. Promote resentment toward a race or class of people.
3. Are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group.
4. Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.

This bill was passed to dismantle and ban ethnic studies programs, courses, and literature. School districts then set out to expand
the  list  of  banned  books  used  in  ethnic  studies  classrooms,  preventing  teachers  from  integrating  ethnic  studies  texts  into  their
courses.

 Pause and Reflect

Examine  the  fourth  point  under  Arizona’s  HB  2281.  In  your  opinion,  why  do  you  think  “ethnic  solidarity”  was  presented
negatively and used to justify the elimination of ethnic studies?

The  Mexican  American  Studies  program  emerged  as  a  community-driven  initiative  in  the  late  1990s.  There  was  a  concern  that
Mexican  American  students  needed  a  curriculum  that  incorporated  their  background  and  identities  as  a  means  for  improving
student academic achievement.
 Perhaps what was most unique about this ethnic studies program was the centering of Indigenous
ancestral knowledge, epistemologies (ways of knowing), and pedagogies. The decolonial approach to learning posed a threat to the
daily  operation  of  schools  and  learning,  as  summarized  by  award-winning  MAS  literature  teacher,  Curtis  Acosta  in  “Dangerous
Minds in Tucson,”

Our  Mexican  American  Studies  classes  were  pedagogically  forged  to  combat  the  passivity  and  acquiescence  of  student
experiences  within  the  status  quo  of  public  schools.  Specifically,  in  my  Latin@  Literature  classes,  I  intentionally  created
educational  experiences  that  provided  spaces  and  time  for  students  to  reflect  upon  their  world  through  the  lens  of  the
literature we studied in class. This practice, which was based upon indigenous epistemologies from our local community and
cultural context, provided the foundation to build, not only an authentic classroom curriculum and climate where the students
could  analyze  the  experiences  in  their  world,  but  also  an  immediately  disrupted  traditional  school  hierarchy  through  the
organic injection of student voice as the initial step toward the rigorous study of literature. Through weekly journaling, casual
classroom sharing, as well as formal presentations and discussions, student voice was consistently valued and normalized in
the educational experiences of MAS classes.

The program was a proven success. MAS students outperformed students not in the program when it came to reading, writing, and
graduation  rates.  In  spite  of  the  program’s  success,  the  state  of  Arizona  spent  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  to  discredit  and
eliminate it. The state went so far as to contract Cambium Learning Incorporated to conduct an independent curriculum audit in the
spring of 2011. The results of the audit only served to reinforce the effectiveness of the program and proved that the curriculum
was not in violation of Arizona’s revised statutes 15-112(A). Furthermore, during this time Christine E. Sleeter (2011) documented
an extensive research overview on the academic and social value of ethnic studies in schools and universities.
 As the movement
in  support  of  ethnic  studies  grew,  so  did  the  role  for  research  in  ethnic  studies  at  every  level  of  education  and  in  the  areas  of
curriculum,  pedagogy,  and  policy.  In  spite  of  the  extensive  research  positively  supporing  why  ethnic  studies  is  beneficial  to  all
students, especially students of color, Arizona moved forward with the implementation of HB 2281.

It is no coincidence that the same year HB 2281 presented its attack against ethnic studies, Arizona’s Governor Jan Brewer signed
another controversial bill, Senate Bill 1070 “The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.” This policy was the
strictest anti-immigration law in contemporary history, calling for the implementation of legal racial profiling in Arizona allowing
law  enforcement  to  question  the  immigration  status  of  anyone  stopped,  detained,  or  arrested  for  a  possible  state  violation.  It
criminalized any undocumented immigrant who could not provide the appropriate documentation with a misdemeanor crime and
criminalized  seeking  employment  without  authorization.  While  SB  1070  and  HB  2281  were  ultimately  ruled  unconstitutional  in
court, the devastation caused by these attacks on Arizona’s youth in regard to mental health and communities altogether cannot be
underestimated.

 Sidebar

In 2017, a federal district judge ruled HB 2281 unconstitutional, arguing that the law was enacted with “racial animus” and
used  “discriminatory  ends  in  order  to  make  political  gains.”  The  ban  on  ethnic  studies  in  Arizona  sparked  a  movement  for
ethnic studies in California.

California activists, including many educators and students, protested against Arizona’s SB 1070 and HB 2281. Across campuses,
students  organized  demonstrations  of  all  types–  whether  they  were  teach-ins,  marches,  boycotts,  even  caravans  to  Arizona–  this
outpour of solidarity was powerful. For many involved in these protests, including myself, it served as a reminder that while we
were fighting to save ethnic studies in Arizona, in California, the number of ethnic studies courses available to high school students
was small and in most cases non-existent. The sense of defeat from Arizona’s racist and xenophobic laws were transformed into an
opportunity  to  re-ignite  the  fight  for  ethnic  studies  in  California.  In  the  aftermath,  the  formation  of  conferences,  summits,
campaigns,  and  institutes  devoted  to  teaching  and  organizing  ethnic  studies  grew  stronger  each  year.  The  movement  for  ethnic
studies in California continues to be a force to be reckoned with. For an overview of the growth and institutionalization of ethnic

studies,  review  Section  1.2:  Struggles  and  Protest  for  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Studies.  What  we  are  witnessing  today  is  the
contemporary civil rights movement in education, and the enduring fight for ethnic studies is at the forefront. As the Mexican dicho
(saying) reminds us, “Quisieron enterrarnos, pero se les olvido que somos semillas” (They tried to bury us. They didn’t know we
were seeds). Like the students of yesterday, the students of today will continue to pave the way for generations to come.

 Pause and Reflect

What is the state of ethnic studies today? What new laws, policies, and practices do you observe in support of and/or against
ethnic studies? What is the state of ethnic studies on your campus?

## 8.6: Conclusion

Summary

Brazilian education philosopher, Paulo Freire wrote about praxis––ongoing cycles of theory, reflection, and action––as a practice
of freedom stating,

Authentic liberation - the process of humanization - is not another deposit to be made in [people]. Liberation is praxis: the
action and reflection of [people] upon their world in order to transform it.

This chapter presented historical moments in which communities engaged in praxis to effectively build collective power; in effect,
they transformed themselves and the educational landscape. There are many ways one can study, reflect upon, and work to reform
education.  This  chapter  presented  some  of  the  major  issues  that  have  shaped  and  been  shaped  by  historically  marginalized
communities. This chapter explored concepts to critically understand key debates, issues, and education initiatives. It provided and
overview  of  historical  and  contemporary  laws  in  public  education  that  have  impacted  and  been  shaped  by  Chicanx/Latinx
communities.  Lastly,  extra  effort  was  placed  to  highlight  the  practices,  tactics,  strategies,  and  movements  that  emerge  from
Chicanx/Latinx communities to reform and transform the educational landscape. While it is impossible to present a comprehensive
history of everything, it is a reminder that there is a long legacy of activism we carry with us as we strive for change today. As
students-teachers-scholars, we must be equally invested in engaging in social justice work as we are in studying it. The legacy of
activism in education is one we inherit and will continue to build upon. This is embodied in the image in Figure 8.6.1. The poster
was created for the Poor People’s Campaign, a grassroots movement fighting to end poverty, racism, militarism, and environmental
destruction. The 2018 poster reads, “Learn as we lead, walk as we talk, teach as we fight.”

Key Terms

Deficit-based discourses: Thoughts, language, practices, and representations that communicate deficiencies and failures. Deficit-
based  discourses  such  as  the  labeling  of  minoritized  youth  as  “at-risk”  in  schools  are  disempowering  as  it  is  fixated  on  an
individual’s traits rather than the oppressive structures that cause failure.

Funds  of  knowledge:  Collections  of  knowledge  based  in  cultural  practices  that  are  a  part  of  families’  inner  culture,  work
experience, or their daily routine. It is the knowledge and expertise that students and their family members have because of their
roles  in  their  families,  communities,  and  culture.  In  schools,  this  is  an  asset-based  approach  to  the  knowledge,  skills,  ideas,
practices and overall cultural contributions students bring with them into the classroom.

Community  cultural  wealth:  A  framework  that  recognizes  six  forms  of  cultural  capital  (aspirational,  navigational,  social,
linguistic, familial and resistant capital) that minoritized groups possess. This framework affirms that marginalized groups posses
an array of knowledge, skills, abilities, and networks to survive and resist racism and other forms of oppression.

Overt racism: Conscious, purposeful and deliberate racial hatred that includes speech, ideas, attitudes and behaviours rooted in
white supremacy and directed at racially marginalized groups. More often, racial discrimination that is disguised and subtle, rather
than public or obvious (covert racism).

Assimilation:  The  process  whereby  a  historically  marginalized  person  or  group  voluntarily  or  involuntarily  adopts  the  social,
psychological, cultural, and political characteristics of a dominant group.

Eugenics:  An  ideology  rooted  in  the  belief  that  the  white  Anglo  race  is  genetically  superior  and  to  maintain  this  group’s  racial
purity, it informed social policies, programs, and practices set out to control “undesirable” populations often characterized by their
race, gender, intelligence, physical ability, low socioeconomic status, among other characteristics.

Coded language: A practice long used in policy in which race-neutral terms are used to disguise the racist motives that maintain
power structures meant to sustain white supremacy.

Mutualistas: Community-based  mutual  aid  societies  created  by  Mexican  immigrants  to  connect  them  with  a  network  that  links
their homeland and new home with resources, support, and a community.

De jure: The legal practice. In contrast, de facto describes situations that exist in practice, even if not legally recognized.

Colorism: Prejudice or discrimination based on dark skin color.

Little School of the 400 (LS400): A preschool program that was first created in Texas to teach Spanish-speaking children to be
bilingual by teaching them 400 English words.

Non-violent resistance: A strategy to achieve social change through tactics such as protests, boycotts, sit-ins, marches, and other
forms of civil disobedience that do not promote violence.

School-to-deportation pipeline: School policies and practices that effectuate the removal of undocumented immigrant youth from
schools and ultimately the U.S.

Dominant narratives: The stories we tell ourselves, learn, or share with others- whether consciousl or unconsciously- that are told
in  service  of  the  dominant  social  group’s  interest  and  ideologies.  The  dominant  narrative  serves  to  uphold  power  dynamics  that
serve the dominant culture and groups. These narratives are told at the expense of marginalized groups who are demonized and
blamed (i.e. scapegoat) for society’s social ills.

Bootstraps narratives: The stories told that educational success is attainable through personal initiative, hard work, responsibility,
and drive. Hence, all students need to do is “pull themselves up by their bootstraps” to succeed in school and society. The danger of
these  narratives  are  that  they  begin  with  the  premise  that  students  are  lazy  if  they  underachieve  or  fail,  focus  on  individual  will
rather than institutional barriers, and fail to recognize that not all students have an equal playing field.

Zero  tolerance  policies:  Punitive  school  measures  that  push  out  “problem  students”  through  practices  such  as  expulsion  and
suspension regardless of the severity of a student’s behavior.

School-to-prison pipeline: The school practices and policies that disproportionately place students of color into the juvenile and
adult criminal justice system.

Equality versus equity: Whereas equality means that each individual or group of people are given the exact same resources and
opportunities, equity recognizes that equal outcomes cannot be produced without catering to the specific needs. This differentiation

is essential to create fairness and achieve justice.

Hunger strikes: The literal starvation and the risk of death, as a political tactic to create social and institutional change.

Opportunity gap: Life chances that are determined by the lack of opportunities, which are inherently influenced by factors such as
race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ZIP code, among other social and structural conditions that prevent student readiness and
better educational outcomes.

Praxis: The ongoing cycles of theory, reflection, and action––as a practice of freedom.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 9: Health

 Learning Objectives

Apply theory and knowledge produced by Chicanx and Latinx communities to describe the critical events, histories,
cultures, intellectual traditions, contributions, lived experiences, and social struggles of those groups with a particular
emphasis in the realm of health and health policy.
Critically analyze how health conditions, behaviors, and outcomes are influenced by the intersection of race and racism as
they relate to class, gender, sexuality, religion, spirituality, national origin, immigration status, ability, language, and/or age
in Chicanx and Latinx communities.
Explain and assess how struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation, as experienced, enacted, and
studied by Chicanx and Latinx communities are relevant to current and structural issues such as communal, national, and
transnational politics, for example, public health disparities, environmental justice, and workers’ rights.

Introduction

In this chapter, you will learn about the factors, conditions, and cultural contexts that influence Chicanx and Latinx health. This
includes health outcomes and behaviors that occur at the individual level, like disease, illness, and well-being. It also includes the
collective realities of communities, organizations, politics, and social constructions that influence patterns of health disparities and
inequalities.  Many  negative  factors  like  attempted  genocide,  settler-colonialism,  systemic  racism,  xenophobia,  and  intersectional
oppression  create  distinct  risks  for  negative  health  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities.  However,  we’ll  also  explore  the  many
factors that promote health, strength, resilience, and tenacity among the diverse communities (i.e., Mexican, Mestizxs, Indigenous
Mexican, Central American, Chicanxs, Latinx, South American, Indigenous Latinx, etc.) that make up these populations.

In the first section, you will have the opportunity to explore these broader factors and understand the conceptual frameworks for
analyzing health. This includes a discussion of institutional health, traditional health, and processes that affect migrant communities
and people of color, like acculturation. This also emphasizes the importance of an intersectional perspective, including feminist and
queer contributions to the promotion of Chicanx and Latinx health. Then, you will have an opportunity to explore these concepts in
the realm of mental health, learning about some of the documented disparities in this area. While Latinx people suffer many risk
factors, the “Latino Health Paradox” has been noted by health researchers, as Latinx people fare better with respect to some health
outcomes, especially among first-generation immigrants, compared to non-Hispanic whites and other communities of color.

In the final section, we will be broadening the scope to look at the environments that influence health, including the relationships
between human societies and the natural world, as well as the environments where Latinx people live and work. These topics have
become  discussed  more  widely  in  recent  years,  thanks  to  the  activism  of  social  movement  leaders.  For  example,  the  globally
recognized Indigenous-led struggles to stop and prevent pipeline projects in the U.S. and Canada have elevated conversations about
the  importance  of  protecting  healthy  water  supplies  for  humans.  As  well,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  has  brought  to  society’s
attention  the  working  conditions  that  influence  health  among  many  working-class  communities,  including  industries  that
disproportionately employ Latinxs, including agriculture, retail, logistics, construction, maintenance, and sanitation.

## 9.1: Frameworks for Analyzing Chicanx and Latinx Health

Conceptual Tools for Understanding Chicanx and Latinx Community Health

There is much health and healing of body, mind, and spirit to do given our Chicanx and Latinx history of genocide, colonization,
violence, acculturation, sterilization, hazardous working conditions, environmental toxins, diabetes, intergeneration trauma, abuses,
and more. Views of health are shaped by one's culture, and culture is informed by nationality, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality,
language,  and  dis/ability.   At  the  same  time,  health  access  and  health  resources  are  historically  and  negatively  impacted  by  a
history of anti-Indianness, racism, classism, undocumented status, and region.  The implications of wealth, or net worth (what you
own  minus  what  you  owe)  by  race,  home  ownership,  and  neighborhood  income  is  apparent  in  the  health  inequality  and  lack  of
health access. There are often better health facilities and well-trained doctors and fully staffed medical facilities in more affluent
communities  compared  to  poor  ones.  For  this  reason,  the  emergence  of  community-based  clinics  has  been  critical  to  racialized
ethnic communities, especially in California Chicanx and Latinx communities.

Think about your own experience with health and healing and that of your parents and grandparents. Where have they received
most  of  their  health  and  healing  information?  Both  institutional  and  traditional  health  care  are  key  to  our  communities.
Institutional health care has to do with health care provided by hospitals and with doctors, physicians, prescribed medications,
surgical  procedures,  and  psychiatric  appointments,  which  typically  involve  insurance.  Traditional  health  care  has  to  do  with
Indigenous  ways  of  health  and  healing  of  cuerpo  y  alma  (body  and  soul)  mediated  through  curanderas/os  (healers)  or  other
specialists,  like  parteras  (midwifes)  and  involves  remedios  (medicinal  herbs),  ceremonies,  limpias  (spiritual  cleansings),
sobaradoras/os or sobadas (massage therapist or massage), huezeras/os  (bone  setter),  informal  counseling  for  bilis  (rage),  susto
(fright),  or  envido  (envy),  ancestral  foodways,  and  referrals  to  medical  doctors  if  needed.   Traditional  health  care  has  been  in
existence since before colonization and requires skilled and experienced healers.

There  are  a  number  of  pathways  that  influence  the  relationship  between  settler-colonialism,  white  supremacy  and  health.  These
include  the  types  of  foods  we  eat  and  what  kinds  of  foods  are  available  for  consumption,  as  well  as  the  environments  in  which
communities  live,  work,  and  raise  families.  These  examples  show  how  settler  colonialism  and  white  supremacy  operate  to
reproduce  health  disparities  and  the  ways  that  communities  contest  these  systems  through  resilient  communities  and  collective
resistance.

Traditional Health Practices and Perspectives

In  recent  years,  with  an  alarming  rate  of  cancer  and  research  on  the  connection  between  our  gut  and  minds,  there  has  been  an
attempt to move away from processed foods and move towards decolonizing diets and cultivating gardens.   This  means  moving
towards  the  use  of  ancestral  foodways,  which  includes  Mesoamerican  (Anaucan)  super  foods  like  corn,  beans,  squash,  nopales
(cactus), chiles, amaranth, and chia and regarding food as an essential part of health and healing rather than only for consumption.
However, Chicanx and Latinx communities are more likely to have a hard time accessing fresh fruits and vegetables. In many low-
income  and  immigrant  communities,  few  stores  and  markets  sell  fresh  items  compared  to  alcohol  and  processed  foods  within
approximate  distance  to  homes.  This  can  result  from  zoning  processes  that  place  low-income  residences  and  immigrant  worker
housing in areas far away from central commercial areas and restaurants. Chicanx and Latinx farmworker families who work in the
food industry and provide sustenance for communities around the globe are often directly impacted by these disparities.

In terms of abortion, there are various understandings and stances in Latinx communities. Historically among some Chicana/x and
Latina/x Indigenous women, there is an awareness of herbs (ruda, etc.) and teas that are believed to terminate a pregnancy under
the direction of a healer and seriously considering the context of a woman. Given the understanding of the importance of body,
mind, and spirit and deep connection to cosmology, abortion is viewed by some healers as a sacred decision that can only be made
with  much  prayer  or  meditation  for  permission  from  the  cosmos  or  divine  universe.  In  a  traditional  approach,  the  decision  to
undergo an abortion requires healing and asking for forgiveness specifically of the uterus because it is viewed as the living organ in
which  the  spirit  of  the  aborted  needs  to  be  acknowledged  before  letting  go.  There  is  the  healing  of  the  uterus  as  well  as  the
emotional  healing  for  mental  health.  A  ceremony  of  healing  for  loss  is  needed,  requiring  prayers  in  a  circle  of  women  who
understand life, death, and regeneration, as well as the connection of body, mind, and spirit. On the other hand, the conversation
and practice of abortion for Chicanas/xs and Latinas/xs in the context of Christian and Catholic households is sometimes filled with
stigma,  shame,  and  embarrassment.  Making  the  decision  and  undergoing  the  medicalization  of  abortion  in  isolation  or  secrecy,
without the support of mothers or family members, sometimes poses challenges to health and healing in the body, mind, and spirit.

In “To Valerse Por Si Misma between Race, Capitalism, and Patriarchy: Latina Mother-Daughter Pedagogies in North Carolina,”
Sofia Villenas and Melissa Moreno examined the narratives or conversations and oral life histories of a group of Latina mothers
focusing  on  the  teaching  and  learning  that  occurs  between  mothers  and  daughters  on  gender  and  sexuality  through  consejos
(advice), cuentos (stories) and la experiencia (experience), which are filled with tensions and contradictions yet open with spaces
of  possibility.  Latinas  evoked  patriarchal  ideologies  about  being  a  mujer  de  hogar  (woman  of  the  home),  while  simultaneously
negotiating  these  in  discourses  about  knowing  how  to  valerse  por  si  misma  (to  be  self-reliant).  Mothers  teach  daughters  to  be
submissive,  rebellious,  and  conforming,  all  at  the  same  time,  as  they  maneuver  between  race,  patriarchy,  and  capitalism  in  the
United States.

Traditional  health  through  an  Indigenous  framework  acknowledges  the  connection  and  health  between  body,  mind,  and  spirit.
Another  example  of  Indigenous  health  practices  is  in  the  realm  of  birthing,  which  is  typically  regarded  as  a  ceremony,  where
mothering is considered to be a state of reverence and sacredness as mothers bring life into the world.  The guidance of a midwife
and  doula  is  valued.  You  can  learn  more  about  the  diverse  perspectives  of  midwives  of  color  at  this  blog  site.  Indigenous  labor
practices can involve birthing while squatting, holding on to someone, or using a rebozo (traditional shawl) to be held up rather
than laying on a bed. Postpartum, the healing after birthing, is thought to require la cuarentena, forty days of rest to restore body,
mind,  and  spirit.  Specifically  restoring  the  uterus  from  birthing  the  child  is  important.  This  can  include  the  use  of  eating  and
drinking only warm food elements for one’s body and steady milk production. It can also include using a rebozo or faja (girdle)
around  the  abdomen  for  support  and  receiving  proper  and  gentle  massages.  In  terms  of  connection,  there  is  a  family  ritual  of
burying the umbilical cord in a special place where a child can return for a sense of connection and belonging when and if needed
in their cycles of life. During newborn stages, the baby is swaddled tightly in the hope of providing comfort similar to in-utero and
slow integration into the outside world.

Although  there  are  generations  of  scientific,  religious,  and  cultural  knowledge  embedded  in  traditional  health  practices,  these
perspectives are often disregarded in the face of dominant western healthcare. The positive value of these practices depends on the
continued health and vitality of the communities that carry them forward.

Healthcare Access and Institutional Health

Traditional remedios or medicinal herbs and ancestral foodways for the people connected to land have been impacted by invasion
and colonization by the Spanish and European Americans beginning 500 years ago to 150 years ago, depending on the region in
this hemisphere, and continuing to today through the structure of settler-colonial governments.  When people are de-territorialized
or  displaced,  they  lose  their  land  and  access  to  remedios  (medicine)  and  ancestral  foodways.  In  combination  with  settler-
colonialism,  industrialized  capitalism  has  led  to  the  increased  production  and  sale  of  processed  foods.  When  you  lack  access  to
ancestral food and shift to more processed foods, the increase in sugar, lard, and other chemicals leads to an increase in diabetes
and  other  related  health  conditions.  Diabetes,  in  some  cases,  is  caused  by  the  experience  of  being  torn  from  ancestral  food  and
shifting into colonized foodways.

Acculturation refers to the process of adapting to and adopting cultural practices of a new environment, which can include both
individual change and community and cultural change. In the context of Chicanx and Latinx health, acculturation is often measured
through the number of generations one’s family has lived in the United States. Acculturation is associated with many important

health outcomes, including diabetes, obesity, negative birth outcomes, and substance abuse.
that occurs for Chicanx and Latinx families, which includes systemic barriers in housing, education, and employment, as well as
bias  and  discrimination  against  immigrants.  This  can  impact  health  outcomes  at  the  community,  individual,  physiological,  and
cellular levels.

Institutional  health  care  has  contributed  to  a  range  of  injustices  and  health  disparities.  For  Chicana/x  and  Latina/x,  Native
American,  and  Black  women  there  is  a  history  of  reproducing  injustice  dating  back  to  colonization  and  slavery.
  In  the  early
1900s, the Eugenics Movement mobilized racist theories of intelligence that also enabled the practice of forced sterilization. For
more details on this topic, you can review Section 5.3 on Reproductive Justice. It impacted family formation and served as a form
of population control. This history of medical violence experienced by women of color, including Chicanas/xs, Puertorriqueñas/xs,
and Latinas/xs continues to cause harm in the lives of people who were not able to have children and entire communities who avoid
or delay care due to mistrust of medical providers.
 In Figure 9.1.1, there is an activist poster from the Women’s Conference in
Houston,  Texas  which  leads  with  the  popular  reproductive  rights  framing,  “My  Body.  My  Choice,”  along  with  the  statements,
“Fight  for  Reproductive  Justice”  and  “Real  Feminism  Includes  Trans  Women”  around  a  brown  woman  sitting  in  a  meditative
position.

Accessing institutional health requires health insurance or large out-of-pocket payments. Both of these can be prohibitive for low-
income communities, immigrants, and communities of color like Chicanxs and Latinxs. As well, language barriers can play a role
in the struggle for health access. In some Latinx communities, bilingual or Spanish-speaking promotoras are essential to helping
community members navigate the health system and receive care.
 Promotoras are health workers who have received specialized
training to provide basic health education in the community, who have been key mediators for Chicanx and Latinx communities to
gain  health  access.  You  can  learn  more  about  how  promotoras  have  been  part  of  saving  lives  and  caring  for  communities  with
HIV/AIDS in Chapter 6.

The lack of clean and safe water and toxic pollutants used on crops compounds health issues and avoidable illnesses. The impacts
of  contemporary  food  systems  on  our  bodies,  minds,  and  spirit  have  been  detrimental.  Historically  groups  like  the  United
Farmworkers, American Indian Movement, Black Panther Party and the South Central Los Angeles Farm have raised awareness
about this reality concerning food access and insecurity in Chicanx, Latinx, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)
communities.  Food  is  ultimately  important  to  forming  healthy  families  and  communities.  In  response,  more  and  more  farmers'
markets are emerging in low-income working-class communities, aided by the ability to accept EBT payments (food stamps).

Oftentimes, traditional food and food cultures of people of color are characterized as unhealthy, without regard to their place in
spiritual,  physical,  and  social  processes.  For  example,  outside  observers  may  not  understand  that  certain  dishes  are  meant  for
holidays, special occasions, and family gatherings. While they may build from the same staple ingredients within the diet, daily
dishes are often more modest. In the most extreme distortions, Americanized versions of Chicanx and Latinx foods with processed
ingredients, extreme portion sizes, and unhealthy additives are taken to stand in for traditional foods.

In  some  contexts,  researchers  have  observed  a  pattern  that  can  be  described  as  the  Latino  Health  Paradox.  This  means  that
immigrant  Mexican  and  Latinx  people  report  better  health  and  longer  life  expectancy  compared  to  their  acculturated  Mexican
origin  and  Latinx  counterparts  as  well  as  European  Americans,  includcing  those  of  higher  class  statuses.  Despite  experiencing
discrimination and institutional exclusion, which are typically risk factors that exacerbate bad health, recent migrants carry forward
strong traditions of resilience and well-being. Traditional diet and lifestyle play a major role in the Latino Health Paradox theory.
Fewer years of processed foods, more walking, and less drug and substance abuse by immigrants make a difference in everyday
health and overall longevity.

Institutional  health  has  been  structured  around  the  role  of  doctors  exclusively  tending  to  the  physical  body.  This  perspective  is
supported  by  western  medicine  and,  in  the  U.S.  context,  involved  with  the  for-profit  pharmaceutical  and  health  insurance
industries. However, there has also been a movement towards holistic medicine that has found supporters in hospitals and clinics,
including  formal  partnerships  with  traditional  healthcare  providers.  For  example,  certified  midwives  have  only  recently  been
accepted  to  work  in  hospital  settings  in  the  state  of  California  since  2010.  Nursing  and  breast  milk  have  recently  been  valued
compared  to  the  once  popular  formula  and  commercialized  milk.  Some  hospitals  have  an  option  for  birthing  in  water.  Some
physicians  have  improved  care  for  transgender  and  other  vulnerable  communities.  For  supplemental  exploration  on  this  topic,
explore this short post from UC Davis on the topic of transgender care.

Holistic health practitioners and traditional health perspectives recognize the need to radically shift the current medical system of
health services to a commitment to healthcare for all. The image displayed in Figure 9.1.2 visualizes the activist call for “Health
Care For All!”

Disability Justice among Chicanx and Latinx Communities

Disability  justice  and  the  health  of  the  Chicanx  and  Latinx  community  are  interconnected  in  several  ways.  The  principles  of
disability  justice  emphasize  the  rights  and  inclusion  of  individuals  with  disabilities,  recognizing  that  disability  is  not  solely  an
individual issue but a result of societal barriers and systemic oppression. In the context of the Chicanx and Latinx community, this
means acknowledging and addressing the unique health challenges faced by individuals with disabilities within these communities.

Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  often  faces  disparities  in  access  to  healthcare,  which  can  further  impact  individuals  with
disabilities.  Limited  resources,  language  barriers,  and  cultural  factors  can  hinder  their  ability  to  receive  adequate  healthcare
services and support. Disability justice advocates for a comprehensive approach to health that addresses these barriers and ensures
that  healthcare  systems  are  inclusive,  culturally  sensitive,  and  accessible  to  individuals  with  disabilities  within  the  Chicanx  and
Latinx  community.  This  includes  promoting  awareness  and  education  about  disability  rights,  advocating  for  equal  healthcare
access, and creating support networks that prioritize the well-being and needs of individuals with disabilities in these communities.
By integrating disability justice into Chicanx and Latinx community health initiatives, we can work towards a more equitable and
inclusive healthcare system that promotes the overall well-being of all community members.

 While this is a substantial burden of mental health issues, evidence also suggests that Latinx
individuals experience a lower risk of most mental health disorders compared with non-Latinx white individuals, which means that
we  can  learn  about  important  protective  factors  by  examining  the  practices  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx  groups.  However,  U.S.-born
Latinxs report higher rates for most psychiatric disorders compared with Latinx immigrants.
 Latinxs may identify with different
racial  categories,  immigration  experiences,  languages  spoken,  and  more,  but  all  Latinxs  share  a  common  experience  of  family
origin in Latin America.

Latinx youth are at particular risk of mental health disorders: among Latinx high school students, 18.9% had seriously considered
attempting suicide, 15.7% had made a plan to attempt suicide, 11.3% had attempted suicide, and 4.1% had made a suicide attempt
that  required  medical  attention.
  Furthermore,  Latinx  youth  report  a  higher  prevalence  of  illicit  substance  use  and  initiation  of
alcohol or cigarette use in the past year relative to youth belonging to other racial/ethnic groups.

Factors Impacting Chicanx and Latinx Mental Health

(cid:0)   Content  Warning:  Physical  and  Sexual  Violence.  Please  note  that  this  section  includes  discussions  of  physical  and  sexual
violence.

Several mutually constitutive and overlapping factors contribute to the development of mental health disorders in Latinxs. Latinxs,
particularly those who have migrated to the U.S., report high rates of trauma. Migration, or transnational mobility, entails multiple
vulnerabilities,  including  violence  and  economic  precarity  in  one’s  country  of  origin;  threats  or  risks  of  physical  and  sexual
violence,  dehydration,  kidnapping,  and  exploitation  during  border  crossings;  family  separation;  and  detention  and  deportation.

addition, many Latinxs carry historical trauma relating to European colonization, enslavement, sexual violence, and genocide of
Indigenous  peoples  of  the  Americas.
  Such  reproductive  and  genocidal  violence  continues  with  reports  of  recently  coerced
hysterectomies on (im)migrant women detained in Georgia.

 Reports of trauma exposure are extremely high among Latina migrant women, with prevalence rates around 75%.

Discrimination, Exclusion, Violence, and Health

(cid:0) Content Warning: Physical Violence. Please note that this section includes discussions of physical violence, including violence
against people of color by police and immigration enforcement.

Latinx migrants and their descendants experience discrimination. Both acculturative stress and discrimination have been shown to
impact physical health through the mediating effects of anxiety.
 For example, greater experiences of discrimination moderate the
effect  of  harsh  working  conditions,  increasing  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression  among  migrant  farmworkers  in  the  rural
Midwest.

Restrictive  immigration  policies  and  enforcement  contribute  to  psychosocial  stress  among  Latinxs.  Increased  immigration

to  actively  contest  these  fears.  One  example  of  this  is  shown  in  Figure  9.2.1,  which  displays  an  image  of  two  Latina  activists,
holding  a  sign  that  reads,  “End  SB  1070  and  Family  Separation,”  referring  to  to  Arizona’s  Senate  Bill  1070  that  authorized
widespread  racial  profiling  against  Latinxs  and  immigrants.  The  scene  is  accompanied  by  the  words,  “Nos  Tienen  Miedo”  and
“Porque No Tenemos Miedo,” which translates into English as “They are afraid of us, because we are not afraid.”

Figure 9.2.1: "Nos tienen miedo porque no tenemos miedo" by Jesus Barraza, Justseeds is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

These latter findings are particularly relevant amid intensifying anti-immigrant sentiment and increased deportation in recent years.
In 2016, within days of his inauguration, former President Trump signed Executive Order 13768 entitled “Enhancing Public Safety
in the Interior of the United States,” which expanded deportation priorities to effectively include every undocumented (im)migrant,
promoted increased use of state and local police to enforce federal immigration law through section 287(g) of the Immigration and
Nationality  Act  (i.e.,  287(g)  agreements),  and  directed  the  hiring  of  10,000  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)
officers.
  Following  this  order,  an  additional  52  jurisdictions  signed  287(g)  agreements.  In  addition,  the  Trump  administration
attempted to revoke temporary protected status from individuals who emigrated from Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador; however,
this  effort  was  stymied  by  the  Ramos,  et  al.  vs.  Nielsen,  et  al.  decision  of  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of
California.
  The  administration  also  enacted  a  Zero  Tolerance  Policy  with  respect  to  unauthorized  immigration,  prosecuting
(im)migrants as criminals, detaining them in hieleras (ice-cold cells) and separating children from their parents at the border. The
subsequent  Biden  administration  has  begun  to  counter  some  of  these  policies;  however,  even  by  their  own  admission,  this  is  a
lengthy political process. Beyond that, the harsh policies enacted by the Trump administration have a lasting impact, even as they
are dismantled at the federal level. State and local activists have also continued to mobilize around similar policies, including the
building of a border wall in Texas.

Structural Vulnerability and Health Disparities

Structural  vulnerability—or  an  individual’s  “location  in  their  society’s  multiple  overlapping  and  mutually  reinforcing  power
hierarchies  (e.g.,  socioeconomic,  racial,  cultural)  and  institutional  and  policy-level  statuses  (e.g.,  immigration  status,  labor  force
participation)” —conditions  mental  distress  and  inadequate  access  to  care.  Among  migrant  farmworkers,  harsh  working
conditions  significantly  predict  symptoms  of  anxiety  and  depression.
  Under  the  Personal  Responsibility  and  Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), permanent residents are ineligible for public assistance during their first
five years in the U.S. The public charge rule, a broader interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 212(a)(4),
states that individuals are inadmissible to the U.S. if they are “likely at any time to become a public charge” and has discouraged
noncitizens  from  pursuing  needed  benefits  prior  to  regulating  their  status.
  Although  the  Biden  administration  has  repealed  the
changes to this policy made during the Trump administration, fear persists among immigrants who are eligible to access services.

In  addition,  due  to  their  explicit  exclusion  from  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  undocumented  (im)migrants  have  almost  no  access  to
public health insurance as well as limited options for employer-based or private insurance.

This  structural  vulnerability  contributes  to  barriers  in  accessing  mental  health  care.  Nationally,  Latinxs  have  the  highest

from a general healthcare provider, and just 1 in 20 receive treatment from a mental health specialist.
 Latinx youth are half as
likely as white youth to receive antidepressant or stimulant treatment for depression and anxiety or attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder  (ADHD)  and  attention  deficit  disorder  (ADD),  respectively.
  In  addition  to  fears  of  deportation,  experiences  of
discrimination  and  mistrust  of  the  healthcare  system  contribute  to  patterns  of  healthcare  avoidance  and  non-adherence  to
recommended treatments.

Many of the barriers to mental health care are rooted in the same factors that drive disparities in negative health conditions. For
instance,  immigration  policies  are  often  designed  to  explicitly  and  systematically  exclude  immigrant  communities,  especially
undocumented  individuals.  Further,  even  when  immigrants  do  access  services,  they  face  discrimination  that  can  further  activate
mental health trauma. The provision of services in English only also creates major barriers for communities that speak Spanish or
any number of non-English and Indigenous languages. Beyond that, Latinx migrant communities are often economically exploited
and therefore face barriers at disparately high rates, including the cost of services themselves, access to childcare, transportation,
and the inability to take time off from work. While these barriers are well-documented, more attention is needed to connect these
disparities with potential solutions that can close equity gaps. In the face of nearly insurmountable odds, many Latinxs cultivate
positive mental health and access services as needed.

Mario  Alberto  Viveros  Espinoza-Kulick  and  Jessica  Cerdeña  proposed  a  comprehensive  model  for  mental  health  services  for
Latinx (im)migrant communities, modified from the World Health Organization Optimal Mix of Services Pyramid, which is shown
in  Figure  9.2.2.  From  bottom  to  top,  the  base  layer  is  green  and  labeled,  “Self-care  and  expansion  of  public  health  insurance  to
undocumented individuals.” The second layer is a lighter green and labelled, “Promotorxs and community health workers.” The
third layer is yellow and labelled, “Primary care mental health services.” The fourth layer is labelled, “Advanced health providers
in general hospitals and community mental health.” The top layer is labelled, “Specialist psychiatric services.” The second through
fifth  layers  are  labelled,  “Multilingual  and  structurally  competent.”  The  fourth  and  fifth  layers  are  also  labelled  “Trauma-
informed.”

Figure 9.2.2: “Mental Health Services Pyramid for Latinx (Im)migrant Communities” by Mario Alberto V. Espinoza-Kulick and
Jessica P. Cerdeña, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health is licensed CC BY 4.0.

This model provides a starting point for providers and evaluators to identify the gaps and next steps in solving the inequities in
mental healthcare for Chicanxs and Latinxs. Fundamental to addressing the mental health needs of the widest group of individuals
is  to  expand  public  health  insurance  programs,  including  undocumented  individuals  of  all  ages.  Further,  additional  funding  and
resources are needed to increase access points for service delivery, which often begins with community health workers. Starting
from  this  point,  it  is  vital  to  ensure  accessibility  by  providing  multilingual  interpretation  services  for  individuals  seeking  care.

Increasing capacity for these preventative measures can reduce the strain on general and specialty care providers and provide more
effective care for all. However, even for those who do need more intensive forms of mental health care, communities would benefit
from more providers who are structurally competent, meaning that they can assess how environmental and social factors may be
influencing the individual health of their patients. Related, at every level of care, paid interpreters can ensure multilingual services.
Lastly, effective advanced health providers and specialty psychiatric services benefit from utilizing a trauma-informed approach, to
identify and address the potentially traumatic events influencing individuals’ high mental health burden.

rejection.  Cultural  messages  in  society  in  general  and  among  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  about  LGBTQ2S+  people
communicate denigration and stigma. Further, existing resources and supportive communities for LGBTQ2S+ people tend to
exclude Latinxs, oftentimes are not accessible in Spanish, and tend to take an individual approach that does not address the root
causes of family rejection or social exclusion.

## 9.3: Environmental Justice and Health

Interdependence and the Environment

Indigenous traditions tend to view aspects of the environment as relational rather than as being separated from human society and
communities.
 This perspective underscores the importance of environmental factors to both individual and community health. For
example, pollutants in the air and water affect individual health and can also increase a community’s risk for various diseases like
cancer,  heart  disease,  cholera,  hepatitis,  dysentery,  respiratory  diseases,  and  much  more.  Further,  the  denigration  of  natural
environments also harms plants and animals, which can affect food supplies, water cycles, and natural recreation areas. In Figure
9.3.1,  this  idea  is  represented  through  the  image  of  a  child  looking  into  the  water  to  see  the  outlines  of  adult  figures,  which  is
captioned with the sentence, “What we do to water, we do to ourselves.”

Figure 9.3.1: "What We Do To Water, We Do To Ourselves" by Bec Young, Justseeds is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Structural Inequalities and the Built Environment

Structural inequalities in society mean that unhealthy environments tend to disproportionately impact communities of color, low-
income areas, and immigrants. Chicanx and Latinx communities are more likely to live in areas that have air pollution by industrial
factories  and  large-scale  agriculture.  This  can  lead  to  high  rates  of  preventable  illnesses  like  asthma.  In  the  context  of  climate
change and global warming, the risks to the environment have become more pronounced and severe. This can be observed in places
like  Puerto  Rico,  which  has  suffered  an  onslaught  of  devastating  natural  disasters,  including  hurricanes  and  earthquakes.  The
negative impacts of these events on everyday residents’ health and well-being are made much worse by the prevailing U.S. political
and economic interests that operate on the island.

As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico is politically vulnerable. While the U.S. is responsible for the island, there are no elected officials
who have the authority to hold the government accountable for its response at the federal level. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the
sitting U.S. President downplayed the effects of the hurricane on the island, delayed federal aid, and turned the event into a political
sideshow.  The  island  is  also  threatened  by  inadequate  infrastructure.  In  2022,  after  Hurricane  Fiona,  nearly  a  million  residents
remained in an extended power outage, despite paying some of the highest electricity rates in the country. The existence of laws

like  Act  22,  which  allows  individuals  to  operate  in  Puerto  Rico  without  paying  any  capital  gains  taxes,  encourages  predatory
capitalism that has left the island in a constant cycle of exploitation.

These  same  dynamics  that  are  present  in  Puerto  Rico  are  reflected  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  throughout  the  U.S.  and
Latin  America.  For  example,  critical  infrastructure  and  conservation  projects  in  Latin  America  are  threatened  by  widespread
corruption  and  political  instability,  which  has  been  encouraged  by  decades  of  U.S.  intervention  in  Latin  American  elections,
especially  through  the  CIA  and  organizations  like  the  School  of  the  Americas.  In  the  United  States,  Chicanx  and  Latinx
communities  are  disproportionately  excluded  from  political  representation  through  the  disenfranchisement  of  individuals  with  a
criminal record and the fact that immigrants cannot vote in U.S. elections. This means that Latinx communities are much less likely
to receive funding for neighborhood improvement projects, the development of public parks, and environmental protection efforts.

Environmental Justice Advocacy and Activism

An  environmental  justice  perspectives  takes  into  account  the  interwoven  social,  cultural,  geographic,  and  systemic  factors  that
influence who has access to safe, healthy, productive, and sustainable environments. Environmental justice refers to addressing
environmental concerns in conjunction with other aspects of exploitation and oppression, including white supremacy, capitalism,
cisheteropatriarchy,  and  settler-colonialism.  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  often  suffer  the  direct  effects  of  pollution  and
industrialization, with power plants, chemical refineries, and factories located in disparate proximity to housing.

For example, in Oxnard, California, the group Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy (CAUSE) successfully
advocated against the building of a new large fossil fuel power plant in 2018 called the Puente Project.
 This required four years of
advocacy,  which  was  driven  forward  by  grassroots  mobilization  led  by  Latina  women  in  their  local  neighborhoods.  The
concentration  of  agricultural  business  and  infrastructure  in  the  city  has  led  to  stark  rates  of  health  disparities  for  this  majority
people of color and heavily immigrant community. While people have long felt the effects of these disparities, CAUSE was able to
lead  a  campaign  that  prevented  the  supposedly  inevitable  growth  of  the  power  plants  and  industrial  pollution.  Through  a
combination of raising political support and taking direct, creative public actions, everyday people led by Latina/x activists were
able  to  prevent  the  Puente  project  and  create  a  platform  for  clean  energy,  which  benefits  the  people  of  the  city  and  all  of  the
surrounding communities.

## 9.4: Workplace Health

Factors Influencing Workplace Health

The impacts of external factors on health also deeply influence community health in the context of workplaces. Chicanx and Latinx
people  are  over-represented  in  industries  that  include  a  high  risk  of  workplace  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals,  such  as  agriculture,
gardening,  cleaning,  construction,  and  food  service.  Vulnerability  to  this  exposure  is  made  worse  by  language  barriers  and
exploitation of legal and immigration status. Required safety procedures, training, and materials are often provided in English and
not translated or interpreted into other languages. Further, even when the dangers of poor working conditions are well known and
understood,  employers  may  refuse  to  provide  proper  safety  equipment  or  adjust  the  workplace  setting  and  instead  threaten  the
workers’ legal status to coerce compliance. You can review more about the advocacy around workers’ rights and health in Chapter
# 7: Social Movement Activity.

COVID-19 and Chicanx and Latinx Workers’ Health

During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the topic of workers’ health and safety became a question of national discussion and
policymaking. Employers and politicians constructed the category of essential work to describe the people whose jobs contribute
directly to the daily basic functioning of society, most of whom would be categorized as low-income and working-class workers,
including  agricultural  workers,  retail  clerks  in  grocery  stores,  pharmacies,  and  supply  stores,  and  maintenance  workers.  These
individuals were asked to continue to work and expose themselves to a potentially lethal disease in order to ensure the ongoing
comfort and stability of society as a whole. The image in Figure 9.4.1 shows the representation of Black and Brown workers in
retail,  farmwork,  logistics,  sanitation,  and  office  work  who  were  deemed  “essential”  and  continued  working  during  the  most
dangerous parts of the pandemic. The image includes the words, “My heart overflows with gratitude for the workers giving us life.”

Figure 9.4.1: "Solidarity with Essential Workers" by Melanie Cervantes, Justseeds is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Corporations sought to frame these workers as “heroes” in order to place a symbolic value on this sacrifice without providing any
policy or economic redress. However, labor unions, workers’ organizations, and liberal politicians advocated for employers to be
required  to  provide  safety  equipment,  paid  sick  time,  and  protections  for  workers  who  exercised  their  rights.  However,  despite
these  efforts,  Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  were  still  disproportionately  impacted  by  COVID-19  infection  rates.  Migrant
communities, who were already more likely to be exposed to chemicals and working conditions that deteriorate respiratory health,
were  put  into  the  position  of  risking  infection  and  their  own  health  and  that  of  their  families  to  continue  feeding  the  world.  In
Figure  9.4.2,  an  activist  artist  has  crafted  an  image  of  recognition  and  gratitude,  with  a  Latina  farmworker  carrying  a  box  of
tomatoes surrounded by palm fronds and the words “Migrant Womxn Feed the World” written across the produce box.

Figure 9.4.2: "Migrant Women Feed the World" by Gabriela Aleman, Justseeds is licensed CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  also  reflected  many  recurring  and  long-term  barriers  to  healthcare,  including  a  lack  of  healthcare
providers in Chicanx and Latinx communities, skepticism of physicians, and the exclusion of immigrants and non-English speakers
from health resources.
 This has led to not only higher rates of COVID-19 infection among Chicanx and Latinx communities but
also increased risk of hospitalization, serious symptoms, and death. Even after the virus has been declared endemic by the CDC,
these overall barriers have continued to disparately impact Chicanx and Latinx communities, who are more likely to live and work
in  densely  populated  environments  and  be  subjected  to  continuous  controls  like  mandated  mask-wearing  in  retail,  food  service,
cleaning, and healthcare settings.

## 9.5: Conclusion

Summary

The health and well-being of Chicanx and Latinx communities are influenced by many factors. Throughout this chapter, we learned
about and analyzed aspects of traditional health and healing that have been degraded by generations of settler-colonial structures
and  the  enforcement  of  western  medicine.  These  larger  structures  have  influenced  health  disparities  for  Chicanx  and  Latinx
communities,  including  individual-level  indicators  like  physical  health  and  mental  health.  Institutional  healthcare  has  failed  to
address the wellbeing of Chicanx and Latinx communities, ranging from direct violence at the hands of medical practitioners to
exclusions in health policy and bias and discrimination in the delivery of healthcare.

Yet, communities, healthcare providers, and activists have continued to sustain traditional practices of health and healing for the
present and future generations. This work addresses the disparities and gaps created in the dominant western medical system, and
creates  opportunities  for  collaboration  to  invest  in  holistic  health,  community  wellbeing  and  healthcare  for  all.  With  a  sustained
effort grounded in education, families, and creating spaces of belonging, we heal from the physical, mental and spiritual struggles
of the body, mind, and spirit.

CHAPTER OVERVIEW

# 10: Cultural Productions

 Learning Objectives

Analyze and articulate concepts such as pop cultura analysis, encoding, decoding, stereotypes, controlling images,
tropicalism, disidentification, nationalism, image analysis, and artivism as used by Chicanx and Latinx studies scholars to
analyze the context of media and cultural productions.
Critically analyze how representation and cultural meaning-making operate at the intersection of race and racism with class,
gender, sexuality, immigration status, ability, and Indigeneity in Chicanx and Latinx communities.
Describe the role of cultural productions in reinforcing systemic violence in contemporary society based on racial
categorization and racism.
Review how struggle, resistance, racial and social justice, solidarity, and liberation, as experienced and enacted by Chicanx
and Latinx communities are relevant to current and structural issues such as communal, national, international, and
transnational politics and culture.
Investigate how culture contributes to anti-racist and decolonial efforts for liberation, social justice, and equity.

Introduction

This chapter explores the production, distribution, and reception of culture among Chicanx and Latinx communities. We will begin
by operating conceptualizations of identity, community, and social movements in the context of culture and performance. Culture
travels far and wide, and the transnational Latin American music scene is deeply influential for Chicanx and Latinx communities as
well as cultures around the world. In this chapter, we will learn from artists and producers in places like Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, and
more. Cultural productions include all kinds of items, events, and activities, such as news, radio, art, music, television, film, video
games,  clothing,  and  theater.  All  of  these  activities  communicate  values,  narratives,  and  beliefs  that  sustain  cultural  practices.
Further, with the widespread use of social media, culture and content are created and distributed in wide-spanning networks.

Cultural productions (e.g. news, radio, art, music, tv, film, etc.) and social movements will be analyzed to understand how they are
reflective  of  Latina/o/x  ethnic  identity.  Special  attention  will  also  be  paid  to  how  gender,  race,  immigration,  and  sexuality  are
embedded in cultural attitudes and expressions.

10.1: Chicanx and Latinx Identities and Culture

Frameworks for Cultural Analysis

Culture is a system of shared meaning. This includes the narratives, beliefs, behaviors, norms, and customs that establish a group
and  interact  with  identity,  political  structures,  and  social  life.  Some  examples  of  culture  are  language,  art,  music,  food,  religion,
ceremonies,  and  more.  Within  this  broad  understanding  of  culture,  the  “media”  is  a  significant  institution  that  includes  various
groups who professionally create content. Similarly, pop culture (or “popular culture”) refers to those cultural practices that are
produced and distributed for mass audiences. Historically, studies of culture and society have focused within rigid boundaries, such
as  focusing  only  on  the  elite  culture  of  “high  culture.”  However,  this  ignores  critical  components  of  cultural  practices  and  the
people who carry them out.

In  the  context  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies,  Frederick  Aldama  defines  pop  cultura  analysis  in  terms  of  “our  everyday  lives,
scholarly inquiry, and knowledge dissemination. Not all pop culture is made equally—especially when it comes to matters of race,
sexuality,  gender,  and  differently  abled  subjects  and  experiences.”   Chicanx  and  Latinx  communities  often  find  and  claim
representation  in  pop  culture,  as  it  creates  opportunities  to  identify  with  individual  experiences.    Through  representation,
communities create their own sense of self and agency and are better equipped to resist the oppressive narratives imposed on them
by the dominant culture.

Given the prevailing norms of white supremacy and settler-colonialism present in dominant media, engagement in pop culture can
bring about challenges to one’s perceived authenticity. This is especially true with respect to Indigenous identity and a connection
to one’s cultural heritage. For example, Mintzi Auanda Martinez-Rivera notes, “Many scholars and the general public consider that
Indigenous persons cease to be Indigenous if they partake in modernity (broadly construed). In this regard, popular culture, as a
product  of  modernity,  commodification,  consumption,  and  mass  media,  is  often  considered  antithetical  to  the  experiences  of
Indigenous  peoples.”   However,  rather  than  focusing  on  false  distinctions  between  high  and  low  culture,  we  can  follow,  “the
Gramscian approach, [in which] popular culture is a ‘site of struggle between the ‘resistance’ of subordinate groups and the forces
of ‘incorporation’ operating in the interests of the dominant groups.’”

In addition to engagement with mainstream culture, Chicanx and Latinx communities have resisted exploitation and exclusion by
creating unique cultural forms and content. In the 1960s, this was the main focus of the Chicano Renaissance, an era of cultural
flourishing that corresponded to the movements for justice, equity, and civil rights that were central to the political climate of the
era.  This  time  included  the  celebration  of  the  unique  cultural  strengths  of  Chicanx  communities,  including  melding  English  and
Spanish (Spanglish), bold artistic styles, and literary themes that explored the complexity of Mexican American identities.

This chapter builds from a broad conceptualization of culture to take a broad approach to Chicanx and Latinx Cultural Productions.
This includes works that are by Chicanx and Latinx artists and creators, regardless of the specific subject matter. Content producers
range  from  large-scale  films,  television  programs,  radio  shows,  and  performances  to  the  everyday  work  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx
people to create meaning and carry on traditions through daily tasks. Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions also include work
that is intended for or claimed by Chicanx and Latinx audiences. Marketing professionals have been emphasizing the benefits of
dual-language marketing, including the existence of over 60 million Latinxs, with a median household income of $55,658.  Media
catered  to  Latinxs  have  a  wide  reach  into  mainstream  audiences,  including  Selena  (film),  The  George  Lopez  Show,  American
Family, and Dora the Explorer. Finally, Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions also include media produced about Chicanx and
Latinx groups, characters, and stories.

 Encoding and Decoding

Black  cultural  studies  scholar  Stuart  Hall  developed  a  framework  for  cultural  analysis  that  focuses  on  the  processes  of
encoding  and  decoding.   Encoding  and  decoding  is  an  information  transmission  process  that  creates  frameworks  of
knowledge. This includes interpersonal and institutional processes that produce a nuanced relationship between subjects and
their  perspective  and  interpretation  of  the  world  around  them.  Encoding  refers  to  the  process  of  constructing  meaning  in
creating  culture.  This  refers  to  the  producers,  writers,  artists,  performers,  and  others  who  showcase  narratives  and  cultural
scripts. Decoding is the process by which people view, understand, and interpret these stories. Both processes contribute to the
“programme as meaningful discourse” and carry with them frameworks of knowledge, relations of production, and technical
infrastructure. This is visualized in Figure 10.1.1.

Media Analysis in Practice in Ethnic Studies

By examining culture, we can understand and interpret how narratives and meanings impact all aspects of life, including prevailing
inequities and opportunities for resistance and justice. One key component of media representation is the creation of stereotypes.
These are limited representations of individuals that reduce someone to a negative association with their group status. As stated by
Debra Merskin, “stereotypes go beyond obvious manifestations such as name-calling or facile characterizations, rather they drive
Latina  educational  challenges  and  disparities,  contribute  to  disparate  levels  of  domestic  violence,  depression,  internalized
oppression, as well as distressing legal and societal treatment. Hence, understanding media-engendered stereotypical images are, at
least in part, responsible for the denial of opportunity for Latinas in their struggle for identity.”

Controlling Images

Building from the notion of stereotypes, Patricia Hill Collins coined the term controlling images to describe the ways that common
narratives about Black women are used to reinforce exploitative and racist systems. For Chicanx and Latinx communities, specific
stereotypes have been constructed in response to social, political, economic, and cultural systems. For example, tropicalism is a
negative trope that homogenizes Latinx people by focusing on a fixed set of shared traits: bright colors,  rhythmic dancing, and
darker  skin  suited  to  an  “exotic”  locale.  Audiences  internalize  these  images  and  some  resist  them,  creating  a  social  system  that
responds to the prevailing constrictions on identity and representation.

A  common  controlling  image  used  in  the  media  is  the  Latin  Lover.  The  Latin Lover  stereotype  is  a  construction  of  Latinos  as
aggressively sexual and exotic. The trope was developed by white actors like Rudolf Valentino, who played Latin characters with a
vague accent and no specific cultural or familial ties. In his times during the 1900s, this construction supported the idea of Mexico
as  a  wild  place,  which  legitimized  the  prevailing  policy  of  the  time,  incluiding  the  recent  annexation  of  Texas  (1845)  and
colonization of Northern Mexico. Now, the image remains and creates a set of expectations and biases against Chicanx and Latinx
peoples.

Similarly, G. D. Keller identified the range of stereotypes deployed to represent Latinas as love interests to white male protagonists.
First, the cantina girl is characterized by ‘‘Great sexual allure,’’ teasing, dancing, and ‘‘behaving in an alluring fashion.” These are
hallmark characteristics of this stereotype. This is also a form of sexual objectification, and the narrative of a ‘‘naughty lady of easy
virtue.” While the cantina girl is most often presented physically as an available sexual object, the vamp is a trope of an individual
who  uses  their  intellectual  and  devious  sexual  wiles  to  get  what  they  want.  This  poses  a  threat,  counterbalanced  by  the  draw  of
charisma.  The  vamp  is  a  psychological  menace  to  anyone  who  is  ill-equipped  to  handle  them.  By  contrast,  the  faithful,  self-

sacrificing señorita is a woman who usually starts out good but goes bad over time. This character realizes she has gone wrong
and is willing to protect her love interest by placing her body between the threat intended for him, ultimately becoming a martyr.

Repeated exposure to these controlling images can create internal distress for Latinxs, leading to mental health challenges, body
dysmorphia, low self-esteem, and impaired cognitive performance. They also promote predatory behaviors in the form of dating
violence  and  sexual  harassment.   Similarly,  la  doméstica  (the  Latina/o/x  maid/nanny)  is  a  persistent  media  representation  and
stereotype of Latinas.  Represented in productions like Devious Maids, Casa de Flores, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, As Good
as it Gets, Babel,  Spanglish,  Will  and  Grace,  Dirt,  I  Married  Dora,  Dharma  and  Greg,    Veronica,  Closet,  My  Name  is  Earl,  El
Norte, Clueless, The End of Violence, Storytelling, #blackAF, and Family Guy. For example, on the show, Will and Grace, Rosario,
played by Shelley Morrison, is a character who raises comical relief and reflects narratives around social class and occupational
distinctions.  While  the  reality  of  Latinas  in  domestic  work  is  a  social  reality  and  an  important  part  of  cultural  storytelling,  the
representation  in  terms  of  stereotypes  is  limiting  and  reproduces  systemic  inequality.  By  contrast,  on  Dirt,  Dolores,  played  by
Julieta Ortiz, is an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador who works as a maid for wealthy New Yorkers.  As the protagonist,
she  is  politicized  and  contends  with  the  hegemonic  systems  that  exploit  domestic  workers.  This  interrupts  the  prevailing
assumption of marginality among Chicanxs and Latinxs.

 Concept Spotlight: Disidentifications

Among the many narratives promoted through the media, culture also consists of the ways that people understand, interpret,
critique, and recreate those narratives. The term disidentification comes from the book, Disidentifications: Queers of Color and
the  Performance  of  Politics  by  José  Esteban  Muñoz.
 Disidentification refers  to  the  process  of  situating  oneself  within  a
broader cultural narrative while also existing in opposition to that narrative. For example, queer of color subjects may identify
with  heroic  characters  in  pop  culture  that  have  typically  been  portrayed  by  white,  heterosexual  men,  but  defy  and  resist
associations  with  patriarchy,  white  supremacy,  and  U.S.  nationalism.  This  process  reflects  the  stakes  of  both  survival  and
resistance for minoritized subjects.

Due to wide-standing biases in media, it is impossible for some minoritized subjects to fully identify with available images and
narratives. Disidentification provides an alternative solution. When disidentification is used in performances, it can also expose
and  critique  the  problematic  dynamics  embedded  in  existing  systems  of  power  and  control.  This  approach  recognizes  and
analyzes  the  importance  of  race,  ethnicity,  Indigeneity,  gender,  and  sexuality  in  understanding  social  and  cultural  relations.
Queer of color critiques is associated with scholars and critics like Roderick Ferguson, José Esteban Muñoz, Audre Lorde, and
Gloria Anzaldúa who have opened up new fields of inquiry through their research and writing on topics affecting Black and
Latinx people within the LGBTQ community.

10.2: Chicanx and Latinx Storytelling

Narratives and Identity

Black,  Indigenous,  and  People  of  Color  (BIPOC)  communities  have  always  used  cultural  tools,  including  storytelling  and  self-
produced  media,  to  build  a  sense  of  shared  community  and  pride  in  one’s  identity.  Prior  to  written  stories,  oral  traditions  have
communicated tales of tradition, culture, and meaning from generation to generation, evolving and growing with the times. This
has  led  to  the  cultural  scripts  that  form  today’s  literary  contributions,  ranging  from  bilingual  children’s  literature  and  stories  for
young adults to novellas and epic volumes. For example, in 2008, Junot Díaz won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, The Brief Wondrous
Life  of  Oscar  Wao,  which  explores  the  experiences  and  identity  of  Dominican  communities.  Stories  form  the  basis  of  shared
identities and influence the meanings of day-to-day life.

Radio, Podcast, and News

U.S. Latinx/a/o newsmaking can be analyzed as far back as 1848 when Mexicans were made immigrants on their own land by the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The traditional forms of Latinx newsmaking were corridos (story-based ballads) that originated in
the U.S.-Texas borderlands prior to this time. By the early 1900s, Latina/o/x newspapers that emerged, like El Heraldo de México,
El Fronterizo, Arizona Citizen, and El Clamor Público (Public Clamor or Shouting). Most of these newspapers exposed injustices
and demanded public services, all the while urging their readers to mobilize against the mistreatment of Mexicans in the United
States.

The largest of the Los Angeles Spanish language newspapers (circulation of 4,000) was El Heraldo de Mexico (1916-1920), which
billed itself as the "Defender of Mexicans in the United States." Its primary mission was combating discrimination and exploitation
of Mexican immigrants. Headlines such as "The Exploiters Beware! Mexicans Beware!" illustrate calls for collective action, as do
testimonials such as this one:

Excuse the molestation I bring in the name of more than 30 Mexicans who find ourselves here in the desert... They brought
us with the hoax that we were going to camp at Salt Lake… A number of comrades have died on the road. The contractors
promised us a wage of $ 1.75 daily, but it is a lie… Do me a favor and publish these words… so that they serve as a warning
to other fellow countrymen: [that they] not allow themselves to be tricked.

Today,  Spanish-language  radio  targets  Latinx  audiences  through  niche  marketing.  Advertising  campaigns  on  Spanish-language
radio are often developed with the ethnic groups in mind, such as Mexicans in Los Angeles or Cubans in Miami, each of whom has
a unique set of Spanish words and cultural customs.

 Media Spotlight: Tune In! Spanish Radio Stations

You can find various radio stations, including Spanish-language stations, using the website Radio Locator. Some examples of
local Spanish radio stations are listed here:

Radio Nueva Vida (Camarillo, CA)
La Buena (Santa Maria, CA)
La Mejor Network (Oxnard/Bakersfield/Santa Rosa)
La Bonita (Porterville, CA)
Radio Bilingue (Fresno, CA)
Radio Sin Fronteras (Somerton, AZ)

Spanish  International  network  (SIN),  now  known  as  Univisión,  launched  Noticiero  Nacional  in  1981  as  the  inaugural  Spanish
language news program. The first Noticiero National broadcast on June 1, 1981, opened with a dedication from President Ronald
Reagan (sitting before the U.S. flag, his words translated to Spanish with subtitles):

Buenas  tardes.  I  want  to  say  how  happy  I  am  to  help  inaugurate  the  first  national  news  program  carried  in  Spanish...  I
recognize  the  growing  influence  of  Hispanic  citizens  in  our  communities  and  throughout  the  nation...  The  Supreme  Court
once wrote that a free press stands as one of the great interpreters between the government and the people. The medium of
television, in particular in a Special language newscast, is such an interpreter... Muchas gracias and buenas noches.

Two popular news sites that Latina/o/x viewers prefer today are Univision and Telemundo. As shown in Figure 10.2.1, Univision is
an  established  institution  in  the  community,  supporting  local  events  and  celebrations,  such  as  the  Dominican  Day  Parade,
celebrating the ethnic and cultural heritage of Dominican origin people.

Figure 10.2.1: “Univision Float at the 2009 Dominican Day Parade” by André Natta, Wikimedia Commons, is licensed CC BY

In recent years, there has been massive consolidations between media conglomerates. The 2002 merger between the largest Spanish
language  television  and  radio  station  networks  (Univisión  and  Hispanic  Broadcasting  Corporation)  in  a  3-billion-dollar  deal
consolidated  a  range  of  diverse  viewers  under  a  single  network’s  influence.
  This  was  possible,  in  part  due  to  the  1996
Telecommunications  Act  that  passed  to  allow  for  increased  competition,  lower  prices  and  higher  quality  telecommunication
products. The Telecommunications Act virtually deregulated radio, which enabled it to become more privatized. Companies were
now allowed to own as many radio stations as they wanted because there were no longer caps that prevented them from doing so.

As of 2017, 699 Spanish-language radio stations existed in the U.S., out of 11,231 stations total (6%). These stations are widely
utilized,  with  over  90%  of  self-identified  Hispanics  listening  to  the  radio  weekly.  However,  this  is  also  an  under-representation
compared  to  the  U.S.  population,  which  was  approximately  18%  Latinx/Hispanic  in  2017.
  Some  Spanish  Language  radio
networks emerge out of a need to keep the community entertained and informed (e.g., news and policy); as well as to benefit from
the    "untapped'  Latina/o/x  consumer  market.  Latinx  news  producers  assert  that  their  audiences  have  needs  and  interests  that  are
distinct from that of the general market news audience--and that it is their professional responsibility as journalists to address those
particular concerns.

 Community Spotlight: Radio Indígena

Radio stations may also be inclusive of Indigenous Languages from Latin America. For example, Radio Indigena was started
as  an  online-only  access  station  in  2014  by  the  Mixteco  Indigena  Community  Organizing  Project  (MICOP).  By  2017,  the
station had raised enough funds to set up an FM station, which currently broadcasts to the greater Oxnard area on 94.1 FM.
The station meets the needs of predominantly farm working, Latinx Indigenous migrant communities. The content is culturally
appropriate  and  broadcasted  in  multiple  Indigenous  languages,  including  Mixetco,  Zapoteco,  and  Purepecha.  The  programs
feature health, relationships, Indigenous language, culture, and music. Listeners around the country and the world can listen
live from the station’s app or a broadcast-by-phone number: 605-475-0090. For more information, including links to the apps
for Android and Apple, as well as the station’s schedule, visit the MICOP webpage.

With  the  emergence  of  independent  and  DIY  media  platforms,  podcasts  have  become  a  popular  venue  for  Latina/o/x  audio
productions and audiences. Show hosts and producers use platforms like National Public Radio (NPR), Apple Podcasts, Anchor
FM,  and  Spotify  to  broadcast/stream  to  the  public.  Podcasts  enable  artists,  journalists,  and  community  members  to  resist  the
mainstream industry’s hegemonic culture. Shows like Chicas Politicas, Afro-Latinas, and Maria Hinojosa’s Latino USA utilize this
platform to inform their audiences of local, state, and national politics, Latinx life, art, stories, and culture.

Latinx newsmaking produces symbolic systems by capturing and sharing the reality that places Latina/o/x peoples everywhere: as
presidential candidates, first responders, essential workers, etc. Latino journalism provides a prism through which to analyze Latino
political culture. However, we should recognize the limitations and constraints on Latinx newsmaking as well. Like other media,
Latinx news must attract and maintain an audience that can be sold to advertisers through the mediation of audience measurement
rating systems.

Latinx news is also a site of participation in the U.S. political process. Univision and CNN Español are prime sites for electoral
news,  including  debates,  polls,  and  relevant  U.S.  and  Latin  American  policies.  Nationalisms  are  explicitly  pronounced  in  the
process. Contemporary Latinx newsmaking, and conceptualizations of race, language, and class, are evolving social, political and
cultural  processes.
  Latina/o/x  news  makers  understand  the  complexity  of  U.S.  Latinx  Identity  and  often  highlight  the
interconnectedness between American and Latin American culture and society.

 Sidebar: Maria Hinojosa, Futuro Media, and Latino USA

Maria Hinojosa established her own award-winning studio, Futuro Media, to deliver culturally relevant content to Latina/o/x
audiences. As a Latina journalist, Hinojosa has overcome and resisted the tokenization of her identity as the first Latina woman
to be hired at National Public Radio (NPR). Hinojosa is known for hosting her show, Latino USA, which is aired on NPR. She
helped  to  start  the  show  in  1992,  became  the  Executive  Producer  in  2000,  and  founded  Futuro  Media  Group  to  take  over
production in 2010. She has been widely recognized for her reporting and impact on the field of journalism and is the recipient
of a Pulitzer Prize 2022, four Emmy Awards, and an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from DePaul University in 2010.
Her work covers important social issues, including a frequent focus on communities of color, Latinx people, and immigrants.
She is shown in Figure 10.2.2.

Video Games and Social Media

While  video  games  are  sometimes  left  out  of  broader  conversations  about  media,  their  importance  and  role  in  culture  are
undeniable. Video games make up a $100 billion industry with millions of users. Games offer an interactive site for storytelling,
cultural production, and critique. However, stereotypes are often reinforced and perpetuated by production and writing teams that
are not representative of the stories they are telling. Further, in multiplayer and online games, virtual communities can perpetuate
bullying,  racism,  discrimination,  white  supremacy  culture,  sexism,  settler-colonialism,  and  other  forms  of  systemic
marginalization.

The disparities in gaming culture are reflected in the industry that produces games. There are major opportunity gaps within the
game industry, which exclude communities of color. Only 5% of game developers are Latinx, 2% are Arab/Middle Eastern, 2% are

Aboriginal or Indigenous, and 1% are Black. Hardcore gamers are the imagined audience for many producers, with white cisgender
males as the stereotypical expectation. Disregarding and diminishing casual gamers delegitimizes women and people of color, who
 Indie gaming industries have emerged to contest these dynamics and
are less likely to fit the cultural script of a hardcore gamer.
cultivate diverse narratives within games. However, they tend to have a much smaller reach than mainstream games with massive
production and distribution budgets. Organized gatherings, like the Game Devs of Color Expo cultivate the positive representation
of communities of color within gaming communities.

Latinxs make up a proportional segment of the gaming community and are more likely to identify as a "Gamer" (19%), compared
to the general population.
 However, Latinxs make up only 4% of game producers, and games widely include negative stereotypes
of Chicanx and Latinx people. For example, Ubisoft's Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands falsely places a narrative of Mexican
drug  cartels  in  Bolivia,  producing  a  harmful  generalization  of  Latinos  as  "bad  hombres"    Gamers  and  producers  are  coming
together to combat the bias in the mainstream industry and misrepresentation of Latinx gamers and characters, like the Latinx in
Gaming initiative and Latinx Games Festival.

Historically underrepresented groups in video games have used new media and increased access to technology to resist racism and
intersectional  oppression  in  the  gaming  industry.  For  example,  interactive  platforms  like  Twitch,  Twitter,  and  YouTube  allow
gamers  to  create  supportive  spaces  for  communities  of  color  to  exist  and  game  together.    Expos,  non-profits,  and  professional
associations help support people of color throughout the gaming industry. Transforming the culture of oppression in gaming will
require challenging long-held assumptions about who makes and who plays games.

Relatedly, the widespread use of new media technologies has fundamentally shifted the dynamics of pop culture and storytelling. In
some  ways,  new  technologies  lead  to  greater  opportunities  for  historically  underserved  groups  to  gain  recognition  and  produce
cultural narratives. Changes in the industry create openings for new voices and encourage diversity and inclusion. Many of these
changes  are  then  sustained  to  retain  viewers  and  gain  new  followers.  New  technologies  can  also  reproduce  existing  dynamics,
especially of racism, sexism, and capitalist exploitation. For example, while YouTube lowers the barriers to entry for contemporary
artists, the DIY approach contributes to reproducing the status quo because the platform does not specifically invest in artists of

10.3: National and Transnational Rhythmic Formations

Regional and Local Styles

One  of  the  common  themes  in  Chicanx  and  Latinx  music  and  dance  is  the  use  of  regionally  specific  instruments,  rhythms,
melodies, and themes to showcase pride in one’s identity and heritage. These songs are as diverse as the people who created them
and represent distinct styles, sensibilities, and messages. And, to varying degrees, these songs reflect and reproduce existing socio-
political realities like national identity, borders, and more.

Music played an important role in the development of Chicano identity and political movements. Groups like Chicano Batman and
Las  Cafeteras  from  Los  Angeles  and  Califanes  from  Mexico  City  reflect  the  transnational  character  of  Chicanx  communities’
experiences, which reflects the distinctive combination of Indigenous, Mexican, Spanish, and American traditions into something
wholly  new.  Similarly,  Tejano music,  sometimes  called  Tex-Mex,  is  known  for  its  use  of  vocal  melodies  that  mirror  traditional
Mexican musical styles, combined with instruments and rhythms with American and European influences. This genre exploded in
popularity  in  the  1990s  with  the  rise  of  crossover  pop  star,  Selena.  It  is  also  both  geographically  and  musically  similar  to  the
Norteño style, which is popular in northern Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States, and reflects a cultural blend
of musical instruments and moving narrative ballads.

Within Mexico, various musical styles are used to promote regional and national cultures. For example, rancheras are songs that
focus on love, beauty, and nature, as well as regional and national pride. They tend to take on a local character, with references to
specific places and activities that resonate with audiences in that region, as well as form a symbolic connection to individuals who
have personal or family ties to these other regions. Another common style is corridos, which use complex narrative to tell stories
through  song.  This  genre  inspired  American  country  music,  which  utilizes  similar  narrative  formats  and  styles.  In  addition,
boleros are songs with a slow or moderate tempo and a repeating rhythm that supports a strong melody by the lead singer. These
are rooted in Cuban and Spanish influences that were reinvented by Mexican composers.

 Artist Spotlight: Selena Quintanilla

Selena Quintanilla, more commonly known as Selena, was born on April 16, 1971, in Lake Jackson, Texas. Selena grew up
speaking  English,  but  her  father  taught  her  to  sing  in  Spanish  so  she  could  resonate  with  the  Latinx  community  and  have  a
broader appeal as a recording artist. Known as the "Queen of Tejano Music," Selena Quintanilla was a beloved Latin recording
artist who was killed by the president of her fan club, Yolanda Saldivar, on the 31st of March of 1995 at age 23. In addition to
the  significance  of  her  music,  she  was  an  important  figure  in  representing  Tejana  culture.  Related  to  this,  Frances  Aparicio
stated:

Selena  reaffirmed  a  Tejana  identity  through  her  repertoire,  her  fashion  and  style,  and  her  persona…  her  musical
selections, arrangements, and hybrid fusion of tejano music with other musical forms, allowed Selena to create a larger,
Latin American and Latino/a audience that identified with her.

After her untimely death, Selena has continued to be a central cultural figure for Tejanx, U.S. and Latinx cultures. As shown in
Figure 10.3.1, a mural by Alan Calvo depicts Selena in the now iconic purple jumpsuit she wore during her last concert before
her death.

Figure 10.3.1: “Selena at Alamo Candy” by Alan Calvo via NoNo Joe, Flickr is licensed CC BY-NC 2.0.

Other  styles  represent  the  history  and  identity  of  the  places  they  are  from.  For  example,  bachata  grew  out  of  the  fusion  of
European and African influences with Indigenous Taino sounds, reflecting the rich and diverse culture of the Dominican Republic.
Similarly, cumbia comes out of Colombia and reflects the unique combination of European, African, and Indigenous influences of
the Colombian peoples. Other styles, like reggaeton, have developed with a more regional and global character. While the genre
originated  in  Panama,  it  spread  to  Puerto  Rico  and  rose  to  prominence  there  and  brought  together  Afro-descendent  styles  from
Panama, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and the United States (particularly, Afro-Latinx communities in New York
City).

Folk Dances

In  1952,  Amalia  Hernandez  established  the  Ballet  Folklórico  de  México,  which  synthesized  local  folk  dances  and  Indigenous
traditions  into  a  nationalistic  dance  style.  This  effort  was  supported  by  the  government,  who  encouraged  the  celebration  of  folk
dance  to  promote  a  positive  national  identity,  encourage  tourism,  and  cultivate  local  economic  development.  The  style  of  ballet
folklórico has become popular in the United States, with local groups and schools sponsoring dance groups and holding lessons for
children, adolescents, and adults. Figure 10.3.2 shows an example of a ballet folklórico performance.

Figure 10.3.2: “Ballet Folklorico Imagenes Mexicanas” by Benny Mazur, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY 2.0.

Before  Ballet  Folklorico  emerged,  danza  existed.  In  addition  to  the  nationalistic  style  that  celebrates  the  general  tradition  of
Indigenous cultures in Mexico, communities also carry on specific dance forms and performances. For example, in Michoacan, the
Danza de los Viejitos (Tharep’ Hiti Huarar'i in Purépecha) has dancers who dress in traditional attire with masks of old men and
women. The dancers use canes and play at being hunched over and feeble throughout the dance. The early origins of this dance are
thought to reflect narratives about aging and humor. After European and Spanish colonization, the dance changed somewhat, and

now  includes  elements  of  poking  fun  at  elderly  Spanish  men  who  have  exerted  colonial  power.  An  example  of  this  dance  in
Pátzcuaro, Michoácan, México is displayed in Figure 10.3.3

Figure 10.3.3: “Pátzcuaro Viejitos” by LBM1948, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0.

Other local dances that are still carried on today include the Danza del Diablo in Oaxaca, Danza Azteca (Mi'totiliztli), and Danza
del Venado (Maaso Yiihua).

Nationalism, Race, and Indigeneity in Cultural Productions

Nationalism is a social construction, which then takes on its own authority and power to implement policies. While we often take
borders for granted, it takes continual efforts to create and maintain a sense of national identity, which justifies and legitimates the
actions of elected officials and government agencies. Nationalism exists based on the perception of the people who are part of that
nation,  and  the  symbolic  connection  between  a  seemingly  unified  political  body.
  Nationalism  often  constructs  and  reproduces
racial and ethnic hierarchies to enforce boundaries and uphold a sense of national identity.

Nations are primarily and fundamentally constructed through the creation and distribution of shared cultural narratives, images, and
symbols. Contrary to some common conceptions, cultural narratives (e.g., music, fashion, television and more) are not the opposite
of  politics,  but  rather  a  different  expression  of  societal  systems  and  structures.  For  example,  in  a  classical  study  of  self-identity
among Mexican Americans published in 1987, Roger Batra identified four key practices that aligned individuals with a collective
sense of “Lo Mexicano”:

Shout the lyrics to José Alfredo Jiménez’s “El rey”
Whistle during ballet folklórico performances
Purchase Frida Kahlo prints
Visit Rivera’s Siqueiros, or Orozco’s murals

The artists and pieces that centralize Mexican identity change over time, but the use of shared cultural legacies continues.

In  Mexico,  nationalistic  cultural  styles  emphasize  the  commonalities  and  unifying  symbols  that  can  bring  together  diverse
populations across the country. For example, mariachi are bandas (bands) that typically wear full charro/charra attire, signaling a
post revolutionary Mexican aesthetic. This historical reference is important, because this signals an emphasis on the political efforts
to unify the Mexican people to overthrow colonial control and re-establish a locally governed system. The politics of mariachi are
also  gendered.  Historically  mariachi  are  often,  but  not  always,  male-dominated.  However,  key  figures  like  Aida  Cuevas  have
broken barriers for women to perform in this style as respected lead vocalists. As shown in Figure 10.3.4, groups like the Mariachi
Divas highlight women artists and performers.

Performing National Identity in La Tequilera

In the Chicanx and Latinx music worlds, it is very common for popular artists to cover both new and traditional songs by others,
sometimes  changing  the  style  and  tone  in  their  adapted  version.  For  example,  the  song  La  Tequilera  (The  tequila  girl)  was
popularized by Lucha Reyes in the 1930s. In her original version, the telling followed the ranchera style and signaling the soldadera
(soldier) imagery of women in the Mexican Revolution. Since then, the song has been performed by countless women, including
Selena, Jenni Rivera, and Alicia Villaseñor, both reprising this story and infusing it with new meaning.

Astrid Hadad is a Mexican singer of mixed Mayan and Lebanese heritage. In her performances of La Tequilera, she utilizes the
imagery of armed Mexican revolutionary women to signal the original Lucha Reyes version of the song. She also embeds aspects
of  rock  and  roll  to  bring  the  song  into  a  more  modern  era,  focusing  on  current  issues  related  to  gender  equality  and  women’s
agency.
  This  signals  the  ongoing  revolution  against  patriarchy  and  interlocking  systems  of  domination.  For  example,  in  her
concerts,  when  Hadad  sings    “Como  Buena  mexicana  sufriré  el  dolor  tranquila”  (Like  a  good  Mexican  woman,  I  will  suffer  in
silence), she whips herself, emphasizing how women have been socialized into their own marginalization in the name of cultural
  This  is  an  example  of  disidentification,  as  Hadad  is  both  deploying  Mexican  national  identity  through
and  national  identity.
ranchera style, a traditionally male-dominated genre, as a way to critique patriarchal gender roles and patriarchy.

Lila Downs is a globally recognized signer from Oaxaca, Mexico and is shown in Figure 10.3.5. When she has performed the same
song, she shifts the musical style to a norteña, both increasing the tempo and adding elements like the accordion. Because norteño
music is associated with northern Mexico, Texas, California, the U.S. Southwest, and Mexican migrant communities around the
world,  this  gives  the  song  a  transnational  character  and  invites  a  global  Latinx  audience.  Following  this  global-facing  Mexican
identity,  Downs  melds  the  soldadera  style  with  dress  that  reflects  both  traditional  Oaxacan  styles,  as  well  as  the  Mexican
 This flips the significance of the narrative in the song from being about reflecting

Mexican identity within a nationalistic community to representing Mexicanidad to a Latinx and global audience. Links to publicly
available, copyrighted recordings of Hadad’s and Downs’s recordings of La Tequilera are included in the supplemental resources
for this chapter.

Indigenous Rock

Indigenous  identities,  cultural  practices,  musical  traditions,  and  dress  are  all  key  parts  of  Chicanx  and  Latinx  music  and  dance.
These are celebrated through traditional ceremonies, festivals, and rituals, along with day-to-day culture. For example, Pirekua is
music  “that  expresses  the  thought,  feelings  and  pride  of  the  P’urhépecha  people  from  Michoácan,  México,  where  creators
(composers) and the pirericha (performers) manifest all their talent, their creativity and their most profound feelings.”  While this
genre grows out of a long tradition, each generation has adapted and transformed the music to reflect the changing times and their
modern identities.

For example, Hamac Caziim is a Comcáac punk group from Punta Chueca, Sonora that seeks to help young people find pride in
their culture and language. They have also helped to encourage self-expression by helping new rock and punk groups form and
organizing the Festival Xepe an Cöicoos to celebrate Comcáac communities. Similarly, Sak Tzevul is a Tzotzil progressive rock
group from Zinacantán, Chiapas. They originally struggled for recognition especially among their Indigenous peoples but won over
fans and support who were able to recognize the authentic connection of rock music to their cultures and values.

Afro-Latinx Music

People of African descent have been widely influential in the creation of all types of culture in Latin America, despite being under-
recognized  in  political,  social,  and  cultural  domains.  For  example,  rhythms,  instruments,  melodies,  and  styles  rooted  in  African
traditions  are  embedded  throughout  styles  like  meringue,  bachata,  and  cumbia.  Further,  prominent  Afro-Latinx  artists  have
operated through different contemporary genres like R&B (e.g., Cristiana Milian), reggaeton (e.g., Amara La Negra), and rap (e.g.,
Princess Nokia). These artists provide representation and cultural narratives that respond to the specific and diverse experiences of
people of Afro-Latinx descent.

 Artist Spotlight: Celia Cruz

Celia Cruz, in full Úrsula Hilaria Celia Caridad Cruz Alfonso, was born on October 21, 1925 in Havana, Cuba, and she died
July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in the United States. She was a Cuban-American singer who reigned for decades as the
“Queen of Salsa Music,” electrifying audiences with her wide-ranging soulful voice and rhythmically compelling style. She
was exiled from Cuba for her outspoken political and cultural commentary and her fame as an Afro-Latina singer. Even though
the Cuban government had tried to erase her from its history, her fans still living in Cuba commemorated her death by chalking
slogans that read “Azucar! Celia, Cuba te ama!” (“Azucar! Celia, Cuba loves you!”) on walls throughout the island.

Cubanidad can be understood as a Cuban-specific expression of Latinidad, particularly among the Cuban exile and diaspora
community. Celia Cruz contests the homogenization of Latinidad by affirming her Cubanness and Blackness through musical
style and performance. Cruz embedded political speech and acts into her concerts using the Spanish language as well as direct

political  claims,  like  “Bring  Down  Fidel  Castro.”   As  stated  by  one  commentator,  the  complexity  of  Celia  Cruz  can  be
understood in terms of “the image of ‘azúcar negra’... as Celia’s Black body, Afro-Cuban rhythms and voice together indexed
the  cultural  survival  of  slaves  in  Cuba  while  she  simultaneously  vocalized  the  discourse  of  a  pro-capitalist,  white  Cuban
bourgeoisie while embodying colonial desire with her blonde wig.”  An artistic rendition of Celia singing in her iconic blond
wig is shown in Figure 10.3.6.

10.4: Television and Film

Chicanx and Latinx Representation on Screen

When considering the role of Chicanx and Latinx representations on television and in films, Mary Bletrán offers us the concept of
image analysis. Image analysis is an approach that is complementary to a variety of research methodologies, and “can illuminate a
great deal about a media text’s racial politics, as well as its implied ideological messages about ethnic and racial groups and race
relations.”  To undertake image analysis, we go through the following steps:

1. Describe a TV/film character(s) in terms of their most obvious, external representation. How are they presented?
2. Identify the meanings, ideologies, and myths associated with those external traits. What does the character mean to the

audience?

3. Inquire about the narrative significance of this character. Whose story is being told? Which characters are fully developed?

And, what is the balance of power between characters?

For  example,  TV  westerns  in  the  1950s  typically  displayed  Latinxs  as  one-dimensional  stereotypes  (for  example,  Zorro  and
Tanto).  In these performances, Latinx characters were often played by white actors, and they were signified by speaking broken
English, being uneducated, and working in a low-paying job. These representations activated myths about the racial status quo and
the  assumed  superiority  of  whites.  In  the  overall  narrative  structure,  Latinxs  were  typically  not  central  figures  in  the  storyline,
showed little personal development, and were in positions of subservience.

An important counter-example is The Cisco Kid, which ran from 1950-1956, and featured a Latino main character, similar to the
other TV cowboys of the era. However, upon further examination, Cisco is still characterized by the racial ideology of the time,
with the sidekick character, “Pancho,” who is also Latino, has darker skin, more Indigenous features, and his character is portrayed
as less intelligent and important than Cisco. Further, because Cisco was played by Duncan Renaldo (Romanian born American) and
Pancho was played by Leo Carrillo (Californian/Spanish), this reinforced the audience’s perception of racial hierarchy through the
dynamics  of  colorism.  One  of  the  promotional  images  for  an  adaptation  of  The  Cisco  Kid  is  shown  in  Figure  10.4.1,  with  the
description  that  reads:  “The  first  outdoor  talking  feature  in  Old  Arizona,  was  just  a  sample  of  the  vigorous  outdoor  action  and
panorama  of  scenery  which  only  the  technically  perfected  Fox  Movietone  can  capture  on  film.  Here  the  Cisco  Kid,  played  by
Warner Baxter, attempts to outwit Serjeant Mickey Dunn, as played by Edmund Lowe. Audiences are already waiting for this one.

Figure 10.4.1: "The Cisco Kid ad in The Film Daily, Jan-Jun 1929" by New York, Wid’s Films and Film Folks, Inc., Wikimedia
Commons is in the Public Domain, CC0.

Since  the  days  of  Cisco,  we  have  witnessed  many  changes  in  the  representation  of  Latinxs,  including  new  cultural  scripts  and
narratives that Latinx actors and content creators have to navigate. Latina icons are highly recognized Latinas who have achieved a
high-level  celebrity  status.  The  significance  of  these  individuals  for  our  society  can  be  understood  both  in  terms  of  their
commodification  of  ethnic  authenticity,  as  well  as  the  symbolic  resistance  in  ensuring  representation  while  still  working  toward
larger goals.
 For example, this is communicated through pop culture figures as diverse as like Salma Hayek, Frida Kahlo, and
Jennifer Lopez, as well as characters like Dora the Explorer.

Jennifer Lopez is a recognized film sensation, earning $13 million per movie and drawing huge crowds and audiences to her films.
This puts her in a league of elite actors like Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, Halle Berry, and Angela Bassett. She has navigated the
public  perception  of  her  racial  and  ethnic  identity  by  both  emphasizing  her  identity  as  a  Latina  and  at  times,  her  proximity  to
whiteness. Her success as an entertainer in both music and film has given her the opportunity to also take control of her own image
and  star  power,  through  the  clothing,  lingerie,  and  perfume    industries  and  by  starting  her  own  production  company,  Nuyorican
Films.
 Figure 10.4.2 shows her singing at the 59th Presidential Inauguration, signaling her esteemed place in American culture
and society.

Figure 10.4.2: “Jennifer Lopez during the 59th Presidential Inauguration ceremony in Washington, 2021” by Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY 2.0.

Unlike  the  New  York-born  Jennifer  Lopez,  Salma  Hayek  gained  crossover  success  in  American  markets,  after  establishing  her
career  in  Mexican  telenovelas.  Hayek  has  played  various  leading  and  supporting  roles  in  Hollywood  films  but  has  often  been
limited to roles that are defined by her accent and identity as a Latina.
 In response to the negative pressure she has faced in the
industry, Hayek has produced her own films through the company Ventanarosa, which translates from Spanish to English as pink
window. Ventanarosa has produced feature films like Frida (2002) and In the Time of Butterflies (2001) and was instrumental in
adapting the Colombian novela, Yo Soy Betty La Fea (Ugly Betty) which ran on ABC for 4 seasons (2006-2010). In Figure 10.4.3,
Hayek is shown at San Diego Comic Con in 2014.

Figure 10.4.3: “Salma Hayek” by Gage Skidmore, Wikimedia Commons is licensed CC BY 2.0.

An  undeniable  example  of  a  Latina  icon  is  Frida  Kahlo.  Her  image  and  artistry  are  widely  recognized  in  the  United  States  and
around the world. While she was an activist and artist throughout her life, her fame expanded greatly  after her death, not unlike
other iconic Latina figures like Evita, Selena, and Celia Cruz. Now, images of Frida and her self-portraits appear on “stationery,
posters, jewelry, hair clips, autobiographies, cookbooks, biographical books, chronological art books, refrigerator magnets, painting
kits,  wall  hangings,  and  wrapping  paper,  to  mention  a  few  of  the  items  in  bookstores  and  novelty  stores  throughout  the  U.S.,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Spain.”  A photograph of Kahlo is shown in Figure 10.4.4.

 Sidebar: Dora the Explorer

Dora the Explorer debuted with wild success on the Nickelodeon children’s television network on August 14, 2000. Dora, an
animated seven-year-old Latina girl, is the main character in a bilingual cartoon. She has light brown skin, dark brown eyes,

and a voice bounding with endless enthusiasm. She wears orange shorts, a pink t-shirt, and pink-and-white tennis shoes, and
carries a talking backpack and a map that help guide her adventures.

 As published in the Chicago Tribune:

In its first year, ‘Dora the Explorer,’ averaged 1.1 million viewers ages 2 to 5 and 2 million total viewers, according to
Nielsen  Co.  These  days,  ‘Dora’  delivers  an  average  of  1.4  million  viewers  ages  2  to  5  and  2.9  million  total  viewers,
beating out competitors ‘Curious George’ and ‘Sid the Science Kid’ on PBS and Disney's ‘Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.’
Over the years, the show has won a Peabody award for excellence, an NAACP Image award and Parents' Choice awards,
among  others,  and  has  received  16  Daytime  Emmy  nominations,”  and  won  2  Emmy  Awards,  including  Outstanding
Children’s Animated Program.

Nicole Guidotti-Hernández argues that elements of Afro-Latinidad were present in an episode called “Dora, La Música” that

determination by expressing oneself creatively and with music. The comparsa has a contested history because it is a distinctly
Afro-Cuban  practice  that  reflects  African  cultural  retention  and  resistance  to  colonization.
  Comparsa  music  also  has  an

cultural appreciation and knowledge.

Telenovelas, Nationalism, Gender and Sexuality

Telenovelas,  sometimes  just  called  novelas,  are  the  most  popular  form  of  Latin  American  primetime  television  and  cultural
productions  that  can  influence  social  life,  capitalism,  identity,  and  communicate  learning  moments  of  contemporary  social
problems  (e.g.  sexism,  homophobia,  domestic  violence,  etc.).  Their  plots  usually  center  on  love  stories  and  family  life  and  can
 To this day, telenovelas are the most viewed television format

in  Mexico  and  across  Latin  America;  produced  by  networks  like  Televisa,  Telemundo,  and  TV  Azteca.
  They  are  typically
broadcasted 5 days a week, an hour per show, and can typically run for a year or more.

Telenovelas  have  been  used  to  target  consumers  with  messages  intended  to  curb  or  in  some  way  alter  behavior  and  attitudes.
Many  telenovelas  are  inspired  by  a  design  by  Miguel  Sabido,  a  Mexican  Telenovela  writer,  director  and  producer.  He  created  a
novela  named,  Simplemente María,  that  aired  between  1969-1971.  This  novela  was  a  catalyst  for  social  change  and  economic
production. It was found that Simplemente María contributed to an increase in Singer sewing machines and rising awareness of the
working  conditions  of  domestic  workers  in  Latin  America.    Such  changes  in  mindset  yielded  real  changes  for  maids,  including
better treatment by employers and, in some cases, more flexible work schedules that allowed them to pursue their education in the
evenings.
  Novelas  are  powerful  storytelling  platforms.  Through  fictional  narratives,  “lessons”  are  communicated  through
microcosms encoded with prosocial and antisocial behavior (e.g. villainous, innocent, professional, etc.)

Scholars  credit  Sabido  as  a  pioneer  of  entertainment-education  (E-E),  which  is  the  process  of  purposefully  designing  and
implementing a media message to both entertain and educate, in order to increase audience knowledge about an educational issue,
create  favorable  attitudes,  and  change  overt  behavior.
  Novelas  like  María  la  del  Barrio,  La  Rosa  de  Guadalupe  and  Rebelde
(RBD); are only a few that resemble this design. Novelas create and resemble Latinindades in many ways. Brazilian novelas, like O
Bem-Amado (The Beloved)  in  1973  by  Dias  Gomes,  represent  politics  and  identify  new  social  processes  and  forces  that  shaped
socioeconomic and political life in Brazil during the 1970s, including urbanization, modernization, the ‘new’ middle class, and a
more assertive press.

Traditionally  understood  as  feminine  cultural  productions,  telenovelas  now  attract  audiences  of  all  genders,  ages,  sexuality  and
social  classes.  With  expanding  audiences,  we  have  also  seen  increased  representation  of  topics  related  to  gender  diversity  and
sexual orientation in novelas. In many novelas, gender identity and sexuality have been understood primarily in binaristic terms in
which feminine/flamboyant behavior is prescribed to cis-women and gay men, while macho/masculine behavior and caricatures are
exclusive to cis-heterosexual men and masculine gay or bi men in novelas. This leads to feminine and passive gay men being the
 Tate describes further in the following quotation:
most stigmatized character in novelas.

These polarized and farcical gender performances manifest themselves in the limited characterizations of male characters as
either  macho  men  or  locas  (a  derogatory  term  used  to  denote  extremely  effeminate,  presumably  homosexual  men).
Consequently,  for  almost  the  entirety  of  the  past  century,  the  available  gender  narratives  did  not  admit  the  existence  of
masculine homosexuals, nor effeminate heterosexuals, and telenovelas were no exception to this rule.

The  concepts  of  stereotypes  and  controlling  images  can  explain  how  media  representations  exert  power  and  influence  over
individuals’  identities  and  perceptions  of  others.  However,  greater  representation  and  authentic  storytelling  can  break  down  the
barriers and dismantle controlling images that create restrictions on identity.

10.5: Cultural Productions in Practice

Cultural Influence on Politics and Society

In  addition  to  shaping  our  cultural  narratives,  shared  meanings,  identities,  and  practices,  cultural  productions  are  also  a  material
part of our world and activist movements for social change. There are many ways that Chicanx and Latinx communities use culture
to  advocate  for  change,  like  performance,  theater,  poetry,  lectures,  education,  and  more.  As  we  have  learned  throughout  this
chapter,  there  have  been  many  examples  of  how  culture  matters  for  politics.  In  this  section,  we  will  focus  on  some  specifically
activist forms of culture.

Artivism and Politics

Successful mobilization of social movements or movidas depend on the availability of symbolically powerful and relevant cultural
schemas, also known as symbolic resource mobilization.
 These need to resonate with various audiences, including the supporters
of the movement, as well as the targets. Crafting creative, compelling messages is a skill that is honed through practice and artistic
expertise. Art plays a key role in activist movements by communicating demands, claims, and critiques to a range of audiences.
Artivism refers to the combination of art and activism, and the ways in which art is a vehicle for advocating for social change.

The website Justseeds is an activist movement that curates and distributes art for activist groups and their allies. The site includes
paid  artwork  that  can  be  ordered  and  downloaded,  which  directly  supports  movement  artists  and  provides  opportunities  to  raise
awareness  in  one’s  home,  workplace,  or  other  shared  location.  Further,  the  website  also  offers  a  database of Graphics  that  have
been licensed with Creative Commons license so that they can be freely distributed and reproduced in their original format, as long
as they are not sold for money and the artist is attributed. Prominent Latina artists like Favianna Rodriguez and Melanie Cervantes
contribute to the site, along with people from a range of sectors invested in racial justice, decolonization, and liberation. Providing
artistic  resources  help  movements  mobilize  campaigns  and  raise  awareness  about  social  problems.  In  Figure  10.5.1,  it  shows  a
graphic activist poster that emphasizes, “Brown and Proud. Todos Somos Arizona” (We are all Arizona).

 Activist Spotlight: Zines

Zines are another example of pop culture used for both enjoyment and political resistance. A zine can be a physical or digital
piece that typically includes images and texts. It is often created by cutting and pasting magazine items or using a digital style
that  mimics  this  aesthetic.  They  are  also  usually  formatted  to  be  printed  and  folded.  This  is  to  make  them  easy  to  share  in

discreet ways, for example by folding them up and holding them in your pocket, or tucking them into another book. The format
in this instance, responds directly to the need to be able to subtly distribute information to large groups of people. For example,
zines  can  be  used  in  schools,  workplaces,  prisons,  and  other  institutions  to  share  grassroots  information.  Many  groups  have
used  and  adapted  zines  for  their  own  cultural  context  and  political  goals.  For  example:  Muchacha Fanzine,  Black  feminist
queer radical zines, and Accomplices Not Allies: Abolishing the Ally Industrial Complex.

Muralismo

A common practice of activist artwork for activism is the painting of large murals in shared public spaces. For Chicanx and Latinx
communities, this is often referred to as muralismo. These murals communicate narratives, cultural pride, and a strong sense of
shared  space.  In  the  context  of  being  denied  political  representation,  in  the  case  of  immigrants,  and  cultural  and  social
representation, which impacts all Chicanx and Latinx people, artwork becomes a way of positively exercising self-determination
and collective decision-making.

The roots of muralismo can be observed in the practice of mural drawing in Mexico and throughout Latin America, including the
Mexican mural movement. Three prominent figures in this movement in the early 20th century were David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego
Rivera,  and  José  Clemente  Orozco,  sometimes  referred  to  as  “los  tres  grandes.”  The  style  can  be  witnessed  in  places  like  San
Diego’s  “Chicano  Park,”  where  dozens  of  large-scale  murals  transform  a  park  tucked  under  a  freeway  overpass  into  a  cultural
destination and hub for families and community members. One example of the murals in Chicano Park is shown in Figure 10.5.2.
This piece has the text “Nacimiento del Parque Chicano 22 abril 1970, which translates in English to “Birth of Chicano Park: April
22, 1970” and commemorates the historical significance of the space.

Over time, murals have been utilized by Chicanxs and Latinxs of varying backgrounds. In Los Angeles, Judy Baca is renowned for
her mural work, including the Great Wall of Los Angeles, which showcases the Latinx experience and history in LA. Figure 10.5.3
shows Judy Baca restoring the mural in 2011, ensuring that the quality and image are maintained. In spaces where these murals
have been put up, there are appreciable differences in people’s relationship to the space, including both a general sense of pride, as
well as a specific improvement in the safety, upkeep, and liveability of surrounding areas. Because of these documented benefits,
local  agencies  and  government  bodies  have  begun  working  directly  with  artists  and  art  collectives  to  establish,  maintain,  and
preserve murals and other forms of public art.

10.6: Conclusion

Summary

In this chapter, our study of Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions offered a rich and complex framework for understanding the
intersection of race, racism, and other forms of oppression with culture and media. Throughout this chapter, we have explored a
range of concepts and topics, including pop culture analysis, stereotypes, encoding and decoding, controlling images, tropicalism,
disidentification, nationalism, and artivism.

One of the key takeaways from our exploration of Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions is the critical importance of analyzing
representation  and  cultural  meaning-making  in  relation  to  intersecting  systems  of  power  and  oppression.  By  examining  how
cultural  productions  operate  at  the  intersection  of  race  and  racism  with  class,  gender,  sexuality,  immigration  status,  ability,  and
Indigeneity, we can better understand how these productions both reinforce systemic violence and offer opportunities for struggle,
resistance, and liberation.

Furthermore, we have observed how cultural productions have played a crucial role in the struggle for racial and social justice in
Chicanx and Latinx communities, both historically and in the present day. From muralismo to artivism, from telenovelas to zines,
Chicanx and Latinx cultural producers have used their creativity to challenge dominant narratives and offer alternative visions of
the world. By investing in anti-racist and decolonial efforts for liberation, social justice, and equity, we can harness the power of
culture to promote solidarity and transformative change.

Key Terms

Pop culture (or “popular culture”): Cultural practices that are produced and distributed for mass audiences

Pop cultura analysis: A framework that examines day-to-day experiences in combination with academic analysis and structured
knowledge sharing. This pays close attention to the dynamics of race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and ability.

Encoding: The process of constructing meaning in creating culture. This refers to the producers, writers, artists, performers, and
others who showcase narratives and cultural scripts. It is the complementary process to decoding.

Decoding: The process by which people view, understand, and interpret stories. It is the complementary process to encoding.

Stereotypes: Limited representations of individuals that reduce someone to a negative association with their group status.

Controlling  images:  A  concept  that  describes  the  ways  that  common  narratives  about  Black  women  are  used  to  reinforce
exploitative  and  racist  systems.  These  include:  The  Mammy,    The  Matriarch,    The  Welfare  Mother,    The  Black  Lady,  and  The
Jezebel. For Chicanx and Latinx communities, specific stereotypes have been constructed in response to social, political, economic,
and cultural systems.

Tropicalism: A negative trope that homogenizes Latinx people by focusing on a fixed set of shared traits: bright colors,  rhythmic
dancing, and darker skin suited to an “exotic” locale.

Latin Lover: A stereotype Latinos as aggressively sexual and exotic. The trope was developed by white actors who played Latin
characters with a vague accent and no specific cultural or familial ties.

Cantina girl: A  stereotype  characterized  by  great  sexual  allure,  teasing,  and  dancing.  These  are  hallmark  characteristics  of  this
stereotype. This is also  a form of sexual objectification, and the narrative of a ‘‘naughty lady of easy virtue.”

Vamp: A trope of an individual who uses their intellectual and devious sexual wiles to get what they want. This poses a threat,
counterbalanced by the draw of charisma. The vamp is a psychological menace to anyone who is ill-equipped to handle them.

Self-sacrificing señorita: A woman who usually starts out good but goes bad over time. In this narrative, the woman realizes she
has  gone  wrong  and  is  willing  to  protect  her  love  interest  by  placing  her  body  between  the  threat  intended  for  him,  ultimately
becoming a martyr.

Disidentification: The  process  of  situating  oneself  within  a  broader  cultural  narrative  while  also  existing  in  opposition  to  that
narrative.

Tejano  music:  Sometimes  called  Tex-Mex,  this  style  is  known  for  its  use  of  vocal  melodies  that  mirror  traditional  Mexican
musical styles, combined with instruments and rhythms with American and European influences.

Norteño: A style  popular  in  northern  Mexico  and  what  is  now  the  southwestern  United  States,  and  reflects  a  cultural  blend  of
musical instruments and moving narrative ballads.

Rancheras: Songs  that  focus  on  love,  beauty,  and  nature,  as  well  as  regional  and  national  pride.  They  tend  to  take  on  a  local
character, with references to specific places and activities that resonate with audiences in that region, as well as form a symbolic
connection to individuals who have personal or family ties to these other regions.

Corridos:  Songs  that  use  complex  narrative  to  tell  stories  through  song.  This  genre  inspired  American  country  music,  which
utilizes similar narrative formats and styles.

Boleros: Songs with a slow or moderate tempo and a repeating rhythm that supports a strong melody by the lead singer. These are
rooted in Cuban and Spanish influences that were reinvented by Mexican composers.

Bachata: A style that grew out of the fusion of European and African influences with Indigenous Taino sounds, reflecting the rich
and diverse culture of the Dominican Republic.

Cumbia: A style that comes out of Colombia and reflects the unique combination of European, African, and Indigenous influences
of the Colombian peoples.

Reggaeton: A style that developed with a regional and global character. While the genre originated in Panama, it spread to Puerto
Rico and rose to prominence there and brought together Afro-descendent styles from Panama, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Dominican
Republic, and the United States (particularly, Afro-Latinx communities in New York City).

Ballet folklórico: A nationalized version of Mexican folk dancing, which has also become popular in the United States, with local
groups and schools sponsoring dance groups and holding lessons for children, adolescents, and adults.

Danza: Folk dances that communities carry on through specific dance forms and performances among Indigenous peoples.

Danza de los Viejitos (Tharep’ Hiti Huarar'i in Purépecha): A style with dancers who dress in traditional attire with masks of
old men and women. The dancers use canes and play at being hunched over and feeble throughout the dance. The early origins of
this dance are thought to reflect narratives about aging and humor. After European and Spanish colonization, the dance changed
somewhat, and now includes elements of poking fun at elderly Spanish men who have exerted colonial power.

Nationalism: A social construction, which takes on authority and power to implement policies. While we often take borders for
granted, it takes continual efforts to create and maintain a sense of national identity, which justifies and legitimates the actions of
elected officials and government agencies. Nationalism exists based on the perception of the people who are part of that nation, and
the symbolic connection between a seemingly unified political body.

Mariachi:  Bandas  (bands)  that  typically  wear  full  charro/charra  attire,  signaling  a  post  revolutionary  Mexican  aesthetic.  This
historical reference is important, because this signals an emphasis on the political efforts to unify the Mexican people to overthrow
colonial control and re-establish a locally governed system.

Pirekua: Music that expresses the thought, feelings and pride of the P’urhépecha people from Michoácan, México, where creators
(composers) and the pirericha (performers) manifest all their talent, their creativity and their most profound feelings.”

Image analysis: An approach that is complementary to a variety of research methodologies, and can illuminate a great deal about a
media text’s racial politics, as well as its implied ideological messages about ethnic and racial groups and race relations.

Latina icons: Highly recognized Latinas who have achieved a high-level celebrity status. The significance of these individuals for
our society can be understood both in terms of their commodification of ethnic authenticity, as well as the symbolic resistance in
ensuring representation while still working toward larger goals.

Parranda: A style with a contested history because it is a distinctly Afro-Cuban practice that reflects African cultural retention and
resistance to colonization.

Comparsa: Music with a quality of resistance because the European-origin majority characterized it as a barbaric African form of
cultural expression located in the past.

Telenovelas (novelas): The most popular form of Latin American primetime television and cultural productions that can influence
social  life,  capitalism,  identity,  and  communicate  learning  moments  of  contemporary  social  problems  (e.g.  sexism,  homophobia,
domestic violence, etc.). Their plots usually center on love stories and family life and can represent political conflict, corruption,

and other moral dilemmas. They are typically broadcasted 5 days a week, an hour per show, and can typically run for a year or
more.

Artivism: The combination of art and activism, and the ways in which art is a vehicle for advocating for social change.

Zines: A physical or digital piece that typically includes images and texts. It is often created by cutting and pasting magazine items
or using a digital style that mimics this aesthetic. They are also usually formatted to be printed and folded. This is to make them
easy to share in discreet ways, for example by folding them up and holding them in your pocket, or tucking them into another book.

Muralismo: A practice of mural making that communicates narratives, cultural pride, and a strong sense of shared space. In the
context of being denied political representation, in the case of immigrants, and cultural and social representation, which impacts all
Chicanx and Latinx people, artwork becomes a way of positively exercising self-determination and collective decision-making.

11.1.3: Discussion Questions and Writing Prompts

Chapter 1 Discussion Questions and Writing Prompts

Prompts  for  discussion  and  writing  assignments  are  included  to  spur  collective  inquiry,  reflection,  and  engagement  with  the
chapter’s materials. You are encouraged to use these for class sessions, assignments, reflective studying, and more.

1. When did you first hear about Chicanx and Latinx studies? What did you hear? In what ways do you relate or find striking

about it? What are the myths and realities about Chicanx and Latinx studies?

2. The field of Chicanx and Latinx studies is deeply rooted in activist traditions. This has included linking the work happening in
classrooms and through education to the diverse struggles of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color groups. Reflecting on the
students, families, and individuals that you learned about in this chapter, what are some strategies that lead to social change?
Consider how these strategies relate to your own life or the things you have witnessed around you. For a more focused exercise,
consider directing the prompt to a specific activist group. For example, you may want to focus on the San Francisco State
College Strikes for ethnic studies in 1968-1969. You can access more primary documents and digital recordings from the Strike
from the SFSU Diva Archive and SF State College Strike Collection at the SFSU Library. To review the full Black studies
Curriculum from Spring 1968, you can visit the SFSU Digital Collections.

3. Chicanx Latinx studies is about representation. In what ways is Chicanx Latinx studies knowledge, people, or culture

represented at your college, community, city, state, and nation? Give examples?

4. Educational institutions can promote freedom, self-determination, and justice, but they have also been places of elite

domination, white supremacy, and settler-colonialism. Considering the schools you attended and where you have lived, what
patterns have you witnessed? You may want to focus on examples of barriers and exclusion, positive work for inclusion and
equity, or both. Be sure to verify assumptions about the demographics of a school or neighborhood. For colleges and
universities, you can find racial demographic information on websites like College Factual or by searching your school’s
website. You can look up information about demographics in a specific place by using the US Census website.

5. What is cultural wealth? What are some forms of cultural wealth in your family or community? How does it affirm your

identity or community? You can review and research community cultural wealth for my information on this writing prompt.
You may want to explore the links listed here for guidance: Summary of Yosso's Cultural Wealth Model and Cultural Wealth In
Higher Education: Putting Assets-based Perspectives Into Practice - Every Learner Everywhere

6. Review some of the demands made by Chicanx and Latinx student activists. Do any of these resonate with your experience on

our own campus? What demands would you make of your administration? How would you modify or update these demands for
your own context?

7. Chicanx and Latinx studies as a field has grown in tandem with ethnic studies and other constituent disciplines. What are the

advantages of focusing on specific community formations, such as in Black studies, Chicanx and Latinx studies, Native
American and Indigenous studies, Arab American studies, or Asian American and Pacific Islander studies? What are the
advantages of a comparative ethnic studies perspective?

11.1.4: Assignments and Activities

Chapter 1 Assignments and Activities

The prompts on this page are ideas for interactive assignments and/or activities used to extend learning from this chapter. These can
be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

Role Play Discussion: Strategizing for Social Change

For this activity, you will divide the class into three groups. Each group will represent a different constituency in the strike for
ethnic studies at San Francisco State College: the Third World Liberation Front, the faculty union, and the anti-war groups who
supported the strike.
In these groups, the class will address a series of scenarios that mirror the experiences of the strikers and the college.
Students should situate their responses to the circumstance based on their understanding of the text and historical examples
referenced in the chapter and course material. Consider priorities, tactics, and context.

Example Scenario

A local newspaper ran coverage of a demonstration where a number of strikers were arrested. In the description of the events,
they  negatively  characterized  the  students  that  were  arrested  and  consistently  called  the  strikers  violent.  Another
demonstration is planned for the next day, and many student activists want to respond to the newspaper directly. Others have
suggested focusing on focusing the demonstration on more peaceful tactics to avoid arrests and being called violent again.
Your  three  groups  are  tasked  with  how  to  move  everyone  forward.  What  options  would  you  consider?  How  would  you
decide who will do what? Take into account that there is limited time to communicate messages to your supporters.

The  instructor  may  adapt  to  emergent  conditions  based  on  what  the  groups  decide  to  do.  For  example,  this  might  include
introducing external factors like additional repressive responses, political pressure, or resistance from other stakeholders.

Suggested Format

Provide the instructions, divide everyone into groups, and review the scenario with everyone. Answer any questions that come
up in the full group.
Give each group a few minutes to discuss amongst themselves how they want to represent their interests in the discussion. Each
group should also identify one or more people who will represent their group in the larger discussions. Others may contribute as
well, but this will help to facilitate a flowing conversation.
Return the large group, review the scenario once more, and provide each group an opportunity to provide their initial remarks.
Facilitate discussion among the groups to achieve a dynamic and unified response to the outlined scenario.
This would be well suited for a face-to-face modality or a synchronous online discussion using video chat technology and
breakout rooms (e.g., Zoom). You could also adapt this to be a guided discussion board or multi-part online discussion in
groups.

Activity: Chicanx and Latinx Studies is…

Each  student  will  provide  a  creative  response  to  the  prompt,  “Chicanx  and  Latinx  studies  is…”  that  is  rooted  in  what  you  have
learned  from  this  chapter  and  the  class.  The  response  should  be  brief,  about  one  sentence,  and  may  highlight  a  definition  of
Chicanx and Latinx studies, or what Chicanx and Latinx studies means to that individual.

This could take on different formats for different learners and styles. For example, using an Online Discussion board in an online
course,  students  could  post  their  short  replies  to  the  prompt  and  have  an  opportunity  to  view  one  another's.  You  can  also  have
students provide their brief reply with a video recording or by completing a template image.

Based on the format option(s) that individuals can submit, the group’s collective responses should be compiled and made available
for discussion.

and Latino/Hispanic populations in particular.

2. What is Latinidad and what interventions have been made to complicate and expand this concept?
3. What is the difference between Latinx and Hispanic? Where did these labels come from and how have they evolved?
4. Compare and contrast the Spanish colonial and U.S. imperial racial paradigms. What are some examples of the ways that these

paradigms manifest in the present day?

5. How have Chicanx and Latinx scholars and activists intervened in hierarchical racial paradigms? In other words, how have they

fought back against repressive identifications to create their own empowering understandings of self and community?

11.2.4: Assignments and Activities

Chapter 2 Assignments and Activities

The prompts on this page are ideas for interactive assignments and/or activities used to extend learning from this chapter. These can
be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

Two Census Questions

Students will have an opportunity to explore how they identify racially and ethnically by reviewing the two census questions  as
seen in (cid:0) Figure 2.1.2. Take a few moments to review and respond to questions 6 and 7 on the U.S. census. When you are finished,
think about why you made the selections you did.

Do the options provided reflect how you self-identify?
Would you change anything about the categorizations or the labels?
How does this form compare to others that have asked for your race and ethnicity, such as school documents, employment
applications, and medical forms?

Wheel of Power/Privilege

Students will be given an opportunity to build on the “Two Census Questions” activity by applying an intersectional analysis to
their  own  lives  by  considering  how  power  structures  (ideologies,  discourses,  institutions,  systems)  shape  their  particular  subject
position, access to resources, experiences, and life outcomes. An option is to have students complete this activity before reading
Chapter  2:  Identities  and  then  revisit  it  after  reading  the  chapter  to  determine  how  their  knowledge  deepened  as  a  result  of
completing the reading.

1. To prepare for this activity, print copies of the “Wheel of Power/Privilege” by Sylvia Duckworth ((cid:0) Figure 2.1) and distribute
them in class or have students in online sections download the digital version. There may be additional social identity categories
not listed in the image that you may want to add or come up with additional categories with students.

2. Ask students to reflect on the ways they identify within each social identity category and circle the label closest to their identity
or experience for each, understanding that the labels they use may not be provided exactly in the wheel. Students can write in
another label and determine its placement. Students should also think about which of these categories are most salient to their
everyday lives and highlight them. They should also think about which categories/identities are less salient and why.

3. After  completing  this  activity,  students  can  journal  independently  or  form  small  groups  to  discuss  where  their  identities  lie.
Where do they experience marginalization and where do they experience privilege? Which social identity intersections produce
particular  experiences?  Consider  how  privilege  is  cemented  for  a  select  few  through  the  creation  and  maintenance  of
hierarchical  social  identity  categories  across  time  and  place  and  the  ways  that  marginalized  communities  have  resisted  their
oppressors'  classifications.  Students  should  be  given  an  opportunity  to  draw  from  their  own  experiences  and  make  personal
connections to Chapter # 2: Identities.

Prompts  for  discussion  and  writing  assignments  are  included  to  spur  collective  inquiry,  reflection,  and  engagement  with  the
chapter’s materials. You are encouraged to use these for class sessions, assignments, reflective studying, and more.

1. What events and people are considered part of the official historical record and why? Whose perspectives are prioritized,

omitted, or distorted?

2. How do worldviews shape the construction of history? For example, in what ways could binary thinking or viewing time as

linear construct a particular view of history?

3. What counts as valid historical evidence and to whom? Can multiple, perhaps contradictory histories exist simultaneously?
4. How has your ethnic, cultural, and/or racial group’s history been represented in textbooks, the media, and the popular

imagination?

5. What is the relationship between imperial histories and the colonial imaginary? Between medicinal histories and the decolonial

imaginary?

6. What are Chicana movidas and how do they help us expand our thinking of the history of social movements?
7. What is the relationship between Chicanx/Latinx literature and history?
8. Who are the historians, knowledge keepers, chismosa/o/xs, or storytellers in your local community and/or in your family? What
strategies do they utilize (eg. collecting photographs, telling stories during family gatherings, sharing dichos or songs, etc)?

11.3.3: Assignments and Activities

Chapter 3 Assignments and Activities

The prompts on this page are ideas for interactive assignments and/or activities used to extend learning from this chapter. These can
be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

Assignment 1 Oral History Project

This  assignment  option  is  written  as  a  major  project  that  takes  approximately  4-5  weeks  to  complete.  It  includes  additional
suggested assigned readings on oral history methods and three scaffolded assignments, including the final project.

Step 1 Preparation

Read up on oral history research methods and discuss in class. The following are suggestions:

“The Historian as Curandera” by Aurora Levins Morales
The Smithsonian Folklife and Oral History Interviewing Guide
UCLA Library Center for Oral History Research
Baylor University Institute for Oral History Resources

Step 2: Interview Proposal

Students  will  select  someone  to  interview,  schedule  the  interview,  and  submit  the  interview  proposal  assignment,  which  should
include the following:

The full name of your interviewee and their relationship to you;
The scheduled date, time, and location of the interview (indicate if the interview will take place in person, via phone or video
chat);
Three or more sentences about why you want to interview this particular individual;
Three or more sentences about what you think you know and what you would like to learn about your interviewee;
A list of 10 or more open-ended interview questions to serve as your guide. Frame your questions around themes you want to
focus on. Include questions about historical eras and important locations (hometown, current residence, etc.).

Step 3: Time-Subject Index, Selected Themes, and Project Proposal

After  conducting  their  interview,  students  will  closely  analyze  the  recorded  audio/video.  This  will  require  you  to  playback  and
review the recording at least two to four times, listening for dates, geographic locations, subjects, and themes. On a sheet of paper,
notate the time in the interview a particular theme, event, and/or place was mentioned on the left margin, and to the right, write
down the theme, event, and/or place, along with a brief description. This process is called time-subject indexing. Index by obvious
breaks in the topic or by time (every five minutes, for example). Once you have done this for the entire interview, you will review
your time-subject index and decide on the important themes, events, and/or places from the interview to focus on for your final
project.  This  option  is  less  time-consuming  than  producing  a  full  transcript,  which  is  an  option,  depending  on  the  course  and
instructor’s preference. Students will submit their time-subject index (or transcript) along with a paragraph describing their selected
themes, and the final project format that they think will best showcase their work. Options are provided in Step 4.

Step 4: Final Project

Possible formats include, but are not limited to the following list and specific parameters should be determined by the instructor:

Narrative essay;
Mini-documentary;
An original painting, drawing, or mixed media visual art project with an artist statement;
Original short story or children’s book (can be mixed genre, fiction and nonfiction);
Another format proposed by the student.

Assignment 2 Chicana Por Mi Raza Digital Memory Project

There  are  many  ways  for  instructors  to  partner  with  CPMR—from  developing  courses  and  assignment  structures  using  our
materials, to creating content for our public website, to undertaking a local oral history/archival collection project as part of the
class. The Chicana por mi Raza Digital Collective has developed a host of teaching materials to assist educators including course
syllabi,  reading  lists,  assignment  structures,  and  guidelines  for  scanning,  cataloging,  and  working  with  the  Medici  System  (our

database).  If  you  would  like  to  use  materials  from  our  digital  repository  in  your  class,  or  even  undertake  a  community  history
project,  and  are  interested  in  working  with  us  to  make  it  happen,  please  contact  the  Project  Director  Dr.  Maria  Cotera  at
mcotera@umich.edu

Prompts  for  discussion  and  writing  assignments  are  included  to  spur  collective  inquiry,  reflection,  and  engagement  with  the
chapter’s materials. You are encouraged to use these for class sessions, assignments, reflective studying, and more.

1. Many states, cities, and communities across the United States now recognize Indigenous People’s Day on the second Monday
of October, in place of the Columbus Day holiday. How does celebrating Indigenous People’s Day challenge existing cultural
norms?

2. Indigenous perspectives and western knowledge have conflicted over the beginning of human life on this planet, reflecting
distinct standpoints. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the hypothesis that humans in the western hemisphere migrated
from Asia over a land bridge is not supported. Indigenous perspectives center a relationship with the land since time
immemorial. How do stories about where we come from shape our sense of self? How do these perspectives reflect a different
understanding of the relationship between people and the land?

3. Chicanx and Latinx communities in the U.S. and around the world are diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, Indigeneity,

nationality, in addition to other intersecting identities. In your essay, identify a specific Chicanx and Latinx community, and
describe how diversity within that community is reflected in terms of a cultural, social, or political norm.

4. Social movements and policy advocates have worked to create change at the local, national, and global levels that make society
more inclusive and respectful of Indigenous peoples. In your essay, identify a social movement that is working against racism
and settler-colonialism that affects Chicanx and Latinx Indigenous peoples and/or migrants. Clearly explain their goals, and
evaluate how they work toward these goals. How have they been successful? What barriers have they faced?

Chapter 5 Assignments and Activities

The prompts on this page are ideas for interactive assignments and/or activities used to extend learning from this chapter. These can
be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

1. Before reading the chapter, have students get out a blank sheet of paper and write the word “Feminism” in large font. Have
them spend 5-10 minutes creating a mind map or freewrite about the issues, characteristics, images, words, and phrases that
they associate with the term. Set the activity aside, and then return to it after reading the chapter. Have students reflect on the
knowledge (and perhaps biases and stereotypes) they began with, and how they now define feminism after reading Chapter 5.
2. Assign the primary documents “Chicanas Speak Out” and “El Plan de Aztlán.” What issues did the Chicana manifesto take up
that were not addressed in El Plan? Why do you think “El Plan” reached foundational status, while “Chicanas Speak Out” did
not enter the Chicano archive? Discuss the relevance of the documents today. What issues are still relevant?

3. Read aloud and collectively analyze the poems “Como Duele” and “La Malinche” in class, emphasizing the importance of

Chicanx oral expressive culture. Additional analysis may be drawn from the relevant sources in the footnotes and bibliography
including “Yo Soy Malinche” and Infinite Divisions.

4. Research the roots of Chicana/Latina labor radicalism by profiling an organization or activist such as the Liga Femenil

Mexicanista, Sara Estela Ramírez, Luisa Moreno, Josefina Fierro de Bright, Emma Tenayuca, Lucy Parsons, Luisa Capetillo,
Dolores Huerta, or Manuela Solis Sager. An excellent source is the “Chicana Por Mi Raza” archive created by the Chicana por
mi Raza Digital Memory Collective, a group of researchers, educators, students, archivists, and technologists dedicated to
preserving imperiled Chicanx and Latinx histories of the long Civil Rights Era. The archive contains hundreds of hours of oral
histories with notable Chicanas, Latinas, and allies and has digitized personal archives for preservation and access. The
overarching objective of the project is to provide broad‐based public access to oral histories, material culture, correspondence,
and rare out‐of‐print publications for use in both scholarly research and the classroom.

5. Students can present their research findings by creating a public campaign to share what they learned in an accessible format

such as a zine, pamphlet, infographic, or an ofrenda (table display) for Day of the Dead.

6. Assign the play “Real Women Have Curves” by Josefina López (Woodstock, IL: Dramatic Publishing, 1990) and do a table

reading of a scene or the entire play. The play centers around a family of women and covers Chicana feminist issues including
female relationships, body image, labor (garment industry), immigration, education, and more. The play was adapted as a
feature-length film (Directed by Patricia Cardoso, 2002) that can be screened in class.

11.6.4: Assignments and Activities

Chapter 6 Assignments and Activities

The prompts on this page are ideas for interactive assignments and/or activities used to extend learning from this chapter. These can
be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

1. Before reading the chapter, write down the term jotería on the board or have students get out a blank sheet of paper and write

the word “jotería” in large font. Ask the students what they know about this word and its meanings. Have they ever heard of it?
What associations do they make with the term? Set the activity aside, and then return to it after reading the chapter. Have
students reflect on the knowledge (and perhaps biases and stereotypes) they began with, and how they now define jotería after
reading chapter 6.

2. Collectively watch the video “Quiero Que Llames Joto” and have a discussion emphasizing the importance of poetry and

cultural production in jotería identity. What language does Yosimar Reyes use to reclaim and resignify the word joto? What
positive associations does he conjure with the word?

3. As follow up to the chapter, assign Chapter 7 of Borderlands/La Frontera: the New Mestiza by Gloria Anzaldúa. This is the

often cited chapter that contains the line, “People, listen to what your jotería is saying.” After reading this chapter and
Anzaldúa’s do you think as a collective we are “listening to jotería”? Have we taken Anzaldúa’s request seriously? Provide
examples from the text or other sources or life experiences to support your answer.

4. Have students read Raul Coronado article “Bringing it Back Home: Desire, Jotos and Men.” He mentions how queer the chapter
of University of Texas, Austin MECHA was in the 1990s when he was a member. What has been the relationship of MECHA
with LGBTQ or jotería members? How has MEChA changed over the years in terms of gender and sexuality? What chapters of
MECHA have been leaders in inclusion of jotería?

5. Research the student organizations Gay and Lesbian Latinos Unidos (GLLU), La Familia, and La Jotería at UCLA (Univeristy

of California Los Angeles), La Familia de CSUN (California State University, Northridge,  or ?Y Que? at Univesity of
California, Berkeley, and the impact they had on their campuses and the community. What are some of the causes they
organized for? What other campuses had chapters (if any) of these organizations? How did these organizations contribute to
joteria studies?

6. Carefully peruse the website Jotería: Documenting Queer Latinx in Los Angeles created by the UCLA Chicano Studies

Research Center. This website highlights and provides an introduction to the different collections of jotería archives housed by
the center and which researchers can access. Some of these archives are the LGBT Mujeres Initiative, the VIVA Records, the
Gronk papers, and more. The website can inspire ideas for further research. This is a great resource.

7. Review the concept of sex positivity with students. How do they understand this concept? Did they grow up in a sex-positive
environment? Where do these ideas come from? How do they understand sex-positivity in their everyday world? Provide
examples. This can be a discussion in small or large groups or a writing assignment.

8. Read the poems and essays by Gil Cuadros in City of God, Claudia Rodriguez’s book Everybody’s Bread or Maya Chinchilla’s

The Cha-Cha Files: A Chapina Poetica.  Have a discussion about the themes in the writings in the book.. How do they speak to
some of the topics they learned about in the class? Did the chapter help them think differently about these topics? Have students
write their own poems or do a visual representation of the poems.

Prompts  for  discussion  and  writing  assignments  are  included  to  spur  collective  inquiry,  reflection,  and  engagement  with  the
chapter’s materials. You are encouraged to use these for class sessions, assignments, reflective studying, and more.

1. Students have been a major part of Chicanx and Latinx social movements. This includes advocacy around education and

schools specifically, as well as broader movements for justice and liberation. Why are students uniquely situated to advocate for
their communities?

2. Individuals who break through barriers are often celebrated for being the first of their kind, such as Sonia Sotomayor being
appointed to be the first Latinx person on the U.S. Supreme Court. These figures become role models, or what some call
“possibility models.” Why does it matter that people see others like them represented? How does this representation affect
communities as a whole?

3. Chicanx and Latinx social movements have used strategies that focus on reform by changing laws and regulations within

existing institutions. Movements have also used radical strategies that seek to transform social institutions and cultural norms.
In an essay, describe and compare two movements, one that uses a reform strategy and one that uses a radical strategy. Evaluate
how the movements were successful in meeting their goals and in creating change in society.

4. Intersectionality plays a key role in shaping people’s identities and experiences, including among Chicanx and Latinx social
movements. For this essay, select an advocacy campaign or a social movement organization that is focused on Chicanx or
Latinx communities. Clearly identify the issue and its goals, and then use an intersectional framework to show the complexity
of that issue based on two (or more) identity categories. This could include, but is not limited to, gender, sexuality, Indigeneity,
immigration status, ability, age, or religion.

Chapter 7 Assignments and Activities

The  prompt  on  this  page  includes  ideas  for  interactive  assignments  and/or  activities  used  to  extend  learning  from  this  chapter.
This can be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

Power Map Activity

All advocacy is tailored toward a specific audience. The technique of “power mapping” can be used to identify potential viable
targets for a social movement. As illustrated in Figure 11.7.1, the basic structure of power mapping is to create a chart. In this chart,
the  vertical  axis  is  based  on  influence.  At  the  top  of  the  chart,  you  will  place  individuals  and  organizations  that  are  the  most
influential with respect to your defined outcome. As you go down the chart, you will place individuals who are less influential. At
the same time, the horizontal axis represents support or opposition, with the leftmost part of the chart being the most opposition,
and the rightmost part of the chart being the most support.

To complete the activity, create your own power map.

1. First start by clearly defining an objective, which should be specifically defined. This might be a policy, or working to eliminate
a concrete disparity, like improving high school graduation rates among Chicanxs and Latinxs, or addressing a specific health
disparity within your city, county, or state.

2. Then, begin filling out the chart relative to that issue by identifying individuals and organizations and estimating their amount

of influence and support to place them on the chart.

3. You can start with the folx you are most familiar with. You may want to also look up elected officials or policymakers, such as
legislators, mayors, or appointed representatives. Some of these people and organizations will be listed in news articles on your
topic.

4. To  complete  the  chart,  identify  the  four  groups  that  you  have  mapped:  Champions  (High  Influence  and  High  Support),
Supporters (Low Influence and High Support), Targets (High Influence and Low Support), Opponents (Low Influence and Low
Support)

5. Finally,  reflect  on  what  you  have  learned  from  this  process  in  a  short  written  response  (250-500  words),  focusing  on  the
question: how can the identified champions and supporters of your issue work to influence the targets and opponents? Note that
successful  social  movements  do  not  always  win  over  all  of  their  targets  and  opponents  to  become  in  favor  of  the  objective.
Sometimes the most effective way to meet an outcome is to move Targets from opposition to neutrality. And Opponents may
continue to work against your objective, but this is not always impactful if they do not have influence.

Chapter 9 Discussion Questions and Writing Prompts

Prompts  for  discussion  and  writing  assignments  are  included  to  spur  collective  inquiry,  reflection,  and  engagement  with  the
chapter’s materials. You are encouraged to use these for class sessions, assignments, reflective studying, and more.

1. The perspectives of Institutional Health Care and Traditional Health Care have often been at odds, because Institutional Health
developed out of a context that systematically targets Indigenous people and Latinx communities. Given the history of mistrust
between Chicanx and Latinx communities, what are some strategies that healthcare providers can use to build strong
relationships?

2. The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the forefront of public attention a number of long term issues in healthcare access, like
language barriers and disparities in health insurance. During the time of the pandemic, government officials funded public
health programs to provide community education, testing, vaccines, and treatment at free or low-cost to all people. What other
health issues would benefit from this type of approach? How would this look similar or different to the response to COVID-19?

3. There are shared patterns of environmental health disparities across different communities, including by race, immigration

status, and socio-economic status. However, in practice, environmental health concerns are always influenced by dynamics at
the local level that shape one’s relationship to their broader surroundings. In a short essay, identify one major factor that
contributes to positive health and one major factor that contributes to negative heath in your local community. Then, analyze
who has the most direct access to their factors.

4. Mental health affects communities in disparate ways, and it can be affected by a number of social, cultural, and environmental

factors. In your essay, identify a specific aspect of mental health (such as healthy relationships, anxiety, depression, post-
traumatic stress disorder, self-esteem, or another related topic) and analyze how multiple factors may affect Latinx or Chicanx
communities with respect to this aspect of mental health. You are encouraged to use an intersectional framework that
emphasizes how identities such as gender, sexuality, immigration status, and more would be relevant to mental health. To
ground your analysis in evidence-based research, you may want to locate research sources for this topic.

based on an activist movement, advocacy campaign, healthcare issue, illness or disease, environmental justice, or more.

Address the following general prompts:

How does the topic you chose to research relate to Chicanx and Latinx communities?
What is the relationship between your topic and Chicanx and Latinx identities, along with intersectional factors?

You should use multiple sources to inform your contribution, such as written text, images, music, videos, and more.

For  an  individual  assignment,  you  can  complete  this  independently.  It  can  also  be  completed  as  a  group,  either  by  having  each
student  complete  an  individual  assignment  and  sharing  it  in  a  group  format  (e.g.,  Canvas  discussion,  free  blog  site,  online
Jamboard), or by having people work in groups to formulate and execute their blog contributions.

You can specify the format or a range of options for format to make the blog post assignment more engaging. For example, instead
of a traditional blog post, students can make Instagram stories or short videos.

Food Access Activity

For this assignment, you will explore the Food Access Research Atlas provided by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) to learn more about the food access in your local areas. Follow the steps listed to complete the assignment:

1. Visit the USDA Food Access Research Atlas website
2. Use the interactive Atlas tool to identify whether the geographic areas where you live and where you attend college are

considered low food access areas or not. You can use the "Food Access Research Atlas" tool and "Atlas Map" to access the data
you need.

3. Once you have identified the food access status of your local areas, write a short summary and reflection of at least 500 words

on what you learned from this exercise.

Your reflection should address the following points:

What did you learn about the food access in your local areas?
How does the food access status of your local areas compare to other parts of the country?
What are some potential reasons for why your local areas have the food access status that they do?
How might the food access status of your local areas impact the health and well-being of individuals and communities?

1. How do Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions challenge dominant narratives and promote alternative visions of the world?
2. How do intersecting systems of power and oppression shape representation and cultural meaning-making in Chicanx and Latinx

cultural productions?

3. How have Chicanx and Latinx cultural productions evolved over time, and what are some of the most significant trends or shifts

that have occurred?

4. What role do cultural productions play in struggles for social justice and liberation, both historically and in the present day?
5. Choose a particular cultural production (e.g., a film, TV show, music video, or artwork) that you believe exemplifies the themes
and concepts covered in this chapter. Analyze how the production engages with issues of race, racism, and intersectionality, and
evaluate its effectiveness in promoting social justice and equity.

6. Reflect on your own experiences with cultural productions from Chicanx and Latinx communities. How have these productions
influenced your understanding of race, identity, and culture, and how do they connect to broader social and political issues?
7. Write a comparative analysis of two or more cultural productions from different historical periods or geographic regions. How

do these productions reflect different cultural, political, and social contexts, and what can we learn from comparing and
contrasting them?

be used to further understanding, retention, and ownership of learner content.

Multimedia Presentation

Research  and  create  a  visual  or  multimedia  presentation  on  a  particular  form  of  Chicanx  or  Latinx  cultural  production  (e.g.,
muralismo,  telenovelas,  or  zines).  Analyze  how  the  production  engages  with  themes  of  race,  racism,  and  intersectionality,  and
evaluate its potential for promoting social justice and equity.

Group Cultural Production

Work  with  a  group  to  create  an  original  cultural  production  that  engages  with  issues  of  race,  racism,  and  intersectionality.  This
could be a film, TV show, music video, artwork, or other creative work. Use the concepts and themes covered in this chapter to
guide your analysis and production.

Create a Zine on an Activist Tradition in Chicanx and Latinx Studies

In  this  assignment,  you  will  create  a  zine  that  explores  an  activist  tradition  relevant  to  Chicanx  and  Latinx  Studies.  Your  zine
should use a combination of text, images, and other visual elements to convey your message and engage your audience. You may
choose  to  focus  on  a  particular  activist  or  movement,  or  you  may  explore  the  broader  historical  and  cultural  contexts  that  have
shaped Chicanx and Latinx activism.

1. Choose an activist tradition that you are interested in exploring. This could be a particular person or movement, or it could be a

broader theme or concept, such as environmental justice or immigrant rights.

2. Plan out your zine by sketching out the layout and content of each page. Think about how you will use text, images, and other

visual elements to convey your message and engage your audience.

3. Create your zine using whatever materials and tools you prefer. You may use digital tools such as Canva or InDesign, or you

may create a physical zine using paper, markers, and other materials.

4. Once you have completed your zine, share it with your classmates or community by distributing copies or posting it online.

understanding  of  gender,  a  far  richer
tapestry  of  biology,  gender  expression,
and gender identity intersect resulting in a
multidimensional  array  of  possibilities.
Thus, gender can also be recognized as a
spectrum  that  is  inclusive  of  various
gender identities.

Whiteness:  A  social  construct  that  has
served  as  the  foundation  for  racialization
in  the  United  States.  Whiteness  is  the
antithesis  of  Blackness  and  is  commonly
associated  with  those  that  identify  as
white. However, Whiteness is much more
than  a  racial  identity  marker,  it  separates
those  that  are  privileged  from  those  that
are  not.  Whiteness  can  manifest  as  a
social,  economic,  political,  and  cultural
behavior  and  power.  For  example,  the
