2.5 ARRAY ADDRESSING

Define a matrix D as the
transpose of matrix C. (D
has 4 rows and 3 columns.)

Elements in an array (either vector or matrix) can be addressed individually or
in subgroups. This is useful when there is a need to redefine only some of the ele-
ments, when specific elements are to be used in calculations, or when a subgroup
of the elements is used to define a new variable.

2.5.1 Vector

The address of an element in a vector is its position in the row (or column). For
a vector named ve, ve(k) refers to the element in position k. The first position
is 1. For example, if the vector ve has nine elements:

ve = 35  46  78  23  5  14  81  3  55

then

ve(4) = 23, ve(7) = 81, and ve(1) = 35.

A single vector element, v(k), can be used just as a variable. For example, it
is possible to change the value of only one element of a vector by assigning a
new value to a specific address. This is done by typing: v(k) = value. A single ele-
ment can also be used as a variable in a mathematical expression. Examples are:

>> VCT=[35 46 78 23 5 14 81 3 55]

Define a vector.

VCT =
    35    46    78    23     5    14    81     3    55

>> VCT(4)

Display the fourth element.
