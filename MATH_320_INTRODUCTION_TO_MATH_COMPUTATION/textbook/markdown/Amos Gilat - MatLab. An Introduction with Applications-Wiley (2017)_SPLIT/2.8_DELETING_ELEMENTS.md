Chapter 2: Creating Arrays

If a matrix has a size of

 and a new value is assigned to an element
with an address beyond the size of the matrix, MATLAB increases the size of
the matrix to include the new element. Zeros are assigned to the other elements
that are added. Examples:

>> AW=[3 6 9; 8 5 11]

AW =
     3     6     9
     8     5    11

>> AW(4,5)=17

AW =
    3    6    9    0    0
    8    5   11    0    0
    0    0    0    0    0
    0    0    0    0   17

Assign a value to the (4,5) element.

MATLAB changes the matrix size

, and assigns zeros to the

>> BG(3,4)=15

Assign a value to the (3,4) element of a new matrix.

BG =
    0    0    0    0
    0    0    0    0
    0    0    0   15

2.8 DELETING ELEMENTS

MATLAB creates a
 matrix
and  assigns  zeros  to  all  the  ele-
ments except BG(3,4).

An element, or a range of elements, of an existing variable can be deleted by re-
assigning nothing to these elements. This is done by using square brackets with
nothing  typed  in  between  them.  By  deleting  elements,  a  vector  can  be  made
shorter and a matrix can be made smaller. Examples are:

>> kt=[2 8 40 65 3 55 23 15 75 80]

kt =
    2    8   40   65    3   55   23   15   75   80

Define a vector
with 10 elements.

>> kt(6)=[]

Eliminate the 6th element.

kt =
    2   8  40  65   3  23  15  75  80

The vector now
has 9 elements.

>> kt(3:6)=[]

kt =
    2    8   15   75   80

Eliminate elements 3 through 6.

The vector now has 5 elements.

>> mtr=[5 78 4 24 9; 4 0 36 60 12; 56 13 5 89 3]

Define a

 matrix.
