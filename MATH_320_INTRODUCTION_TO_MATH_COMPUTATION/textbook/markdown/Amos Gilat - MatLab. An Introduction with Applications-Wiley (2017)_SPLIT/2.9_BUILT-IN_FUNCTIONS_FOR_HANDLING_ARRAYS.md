2.9 BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS FOR HANDLING ARRAYS

MATLAB has many built-in functions for managing and handling arrays. Some
of these are listed below:

Description

Example

length(A)

Returns  the  number  of  ele-
ments in the vector A.

>> A=[5 9 2 4];

>> length(A)

ans =

     4

size(A)

Returns  a  row  vector  [m,n],
where  m  and  n  are  the  size

>> A=[6 1 4 0 12; 5
19 6 8 2]

 of the array A.

A =

reshape(A,
m,n)

Creates  a  m  by  n  matrix  from
the  elements  of  matrix  A.  The
elements  are  taken  column
after  column.  Matrix  A  must
have m times n elements.

Description

Example

diag(v)

When  v  is  a  vector,  creates  a
square  matrix  with  the  ele-
ments of v in the diagonal.

diag(A)

When  A  is  a  matrix,  creates  a
vector  from  the  diagonal  ele-
ments of A.

>> v=[7 4 2];

>> A=diag(v)

A =

Help Window. In this window, select “MATLAB,” then in the Contents “Func-
tions,” and then “By Category.”

Sample Problem 2-3: Matrix manipulation

Given are a

 matrix A, a

 matrix B, and a 9-element vector v.

Create  the  three  arrays  in  the  Command  Window,  and  then,  by  writing  one
command, replace the last four columns of the first and third rows of A with the
first four columns of the first two rows of B, the last four columns of the fourth
row of  A with the elements 5 through 8 of v, and the last four columns of the
fifth row of A with columns 3 through 5 of the third row of B.
