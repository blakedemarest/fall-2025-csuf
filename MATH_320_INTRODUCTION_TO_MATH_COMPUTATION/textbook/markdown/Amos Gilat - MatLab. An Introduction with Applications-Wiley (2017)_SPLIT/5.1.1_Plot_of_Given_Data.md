Chapter 5: Two-Dimensional Plots

This can be done, as was explained in Chapter 2, by entering values directly, by
using commands, or as the result of mathematical operations. The next two sub-
sections show examples of creating simple plots.

5.1.1 Plot of Given Data

In this case given data is used to create vectors that are then used in the plot
command. The following table contains sales data of a company from 1988 to
1994.

Year

1988

1989

1990

1991

1992

1993

1994

Sales

27

To plot this data, the list of years is assigned to one vector (named yr), and
the corresponding sales data is assigned to a second vector (named sle). The
Command  Window  where  the  vectors  are  created  and  the  plot  command  is
used is shown below:

>> yr=[1988:1:1994];

>> sle=[8  12  20  22  18  24  27];

>> plot(yr,sle,'--r*','linewidth',2,'markersize',12)

>>

Line Specifiers:
dashed red line and
asterisk marker.

Property Name and Property Value:
the line width is 2 points and the
marker size is 12 points.

Once  the  plot  command  is  executed,  the  Figure  Window  with  the  plot,  as
shown in Figure 5-3, opens. The plot appears on the screen in red.
