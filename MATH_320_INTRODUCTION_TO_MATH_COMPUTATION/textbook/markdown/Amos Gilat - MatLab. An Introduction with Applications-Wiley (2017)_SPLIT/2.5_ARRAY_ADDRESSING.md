2.5 ARRAY ADDRESSING

Define a matrix D as the
transpose of matrix C. (D
has 4 rows and 3 columns.)

Elements in an array (either vector or matrix) can be addressed individually or
in subgroups. This is useful when there is a need to redefine only some of the ele-
ments, when specific elements are to be used in calculations, or when a subgroup
of the elements is used to define a new variable.

2.5.1 Vector

The address of an element in a vector is its position in the row (or column). For
a vector named ve, ve(k) refers to the element in position k. The first position
is 1. For example, if the vector ve has nine elements:

ve = 35  46  78  23  5  14  81  3  55

then

ve(4) = 23, ve(7) = 81, and ve(1) = 35.

A single vector element, v(k), can be used just as a variable. For example, it
is possible to change the value of only one element of a vector by assigning a
new value to a specific address. This is done by typing: v(k) = value. A single ele-
ment can also be used as a variable in a mathematical expression. Examples are:

>> VCT=[35 46 78 23 5 14 81 3 55]

Define a vector.

VCT =
    35    46    78    23     5    14    81     3    55

>> VCT(4)

Display the fourth element.

ans =
    23

>> VCT(6)=273

Assign a new value to
the sixth element.

VCT =
    35    46    78    23     5   273    81     3    55

The whole vector is displayed.

>> VCT(2)+VCT(8)
ans =
    49

>> VCT(5)^VCT(8)+sqrt(VCT(7))

Use the vector elements in
mathematical expressions.

ans =
   134

2.5.2 Matrix

The address of an element in a matrix is its position, defined by the row number
and the column number where it is located. For a matrix assigned to a variable
ma, ma(k,p) refers to the element in row k and column p.

For example, if the matrix is:

then ma(1,1) = 3 and ma(2,3) = 10.

As with vectors, it is possible to change the value of just one element of a
matrix  by assigning  a  new value to  that element. Also,  single elements can  be
used like variables in mathematical expressions and functions. Some examples
are:

>> MAT=[3 11 6 5; 4 7 10 2; 13 9 0 8]

Create a

 matrix.

MAT =
     3    11      6     5
     4     7     10     2
    13     9      0     8

>> MAT(3,1)=20

Assign a new value to the (3,1) element.

MAT =
     3    11      6     5
     4     7     10     2
    20     9      0     8

>> MAT(2,4)-MAT(1,2)

Use elements in a mathematical expression.

ans =
    -9
