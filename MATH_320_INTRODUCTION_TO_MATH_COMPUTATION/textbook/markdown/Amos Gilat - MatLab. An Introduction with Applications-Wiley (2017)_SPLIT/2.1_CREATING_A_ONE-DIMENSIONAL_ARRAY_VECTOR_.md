Chapter 2
Creating Arrays

The array is a fundamental form that MATLAB uses to store and manipulate
data. An array is a list of numbers arranged in rows and/or columns. The sim-
plest array (one-dimensional) is a row or a column of numbers. A more complex
array  (two-dimensional)  is  a  collection  of  numbers  arranged  in  rows  and  col-
umns. One use of arrays is to store information and data, as in a table. In science
and engineering, one-dimensional arrays frequently represent vectors, and two-
dimensional arrays often represent matrices. This chapter shows how to create
and  address  arrays,  and  Chapter  3  shows  how  to  use  arrays  in  mathematical
operations. In addition to arrays made of numbers, arrays in MATLAB can also
be a list of characters, which are called strings. Strings are discussed in Section
2.10.

2.1 CREATING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY (VECTOR)

A  one-dimensional  array  is  a  list  of  numbers  arranged  in  a  row  or  a  column.
One example is the representation of the position of a point in space in a three-
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. As shown in Figure 2-1, the position
of point A is defined by a list of the three numbers 2, 4, and 5, which are the
coordinates of the point.

z

A (2, 4, 5)

The  position  of  point  A  can  be
expressed in terms of a position vector:
rA = 2i + 4j +5k
where i, j, and k are unit vectors in the
direction of the x, y, and z axes, respec-
tively.  The  numbers  2,  4,  and  5  can  be
used to define a row or a column vector.
Any list of numbers can be set up as
a  vector.  For  example,  Table  2-1  con-
tains  population  growth  data  that  can
be used to create two lists of numbers—
one  of  the  years  and  the  other  of  the
population values. Each list can be entered as elements in a vector with the num-
bers placed in a row or in a column.

In MATLAB, a vector is created by assigning the elements of the vector to a
variable. This can be done in several ways depending on the source of the infor-
mation that is used for the elements of the vector. When a vector contains spe-
cific numbers that are known (like the coordinates of point A), the value of each
element is entered directly. Each element can also be a mathematical expression
that  can  include  predefined  variables,  numbers,  and  functions.  Often,  the  ele-
ments  of  a  row  vector  are  a  series  of  numbers  with  constant  spacing.  In  such
cases the vector can be created with MATLAB commands. A vector can also be
created as the result of mathematical operations as explained in Chapter 3.
Creating a vector from a known list of numbers:

The vector is created by typing the elements (numbers) inside square brackets [ ].

variable_name = [ type vector elements ]

Row vector:  To create a row vector type the elements with a space or a comma
between the elements inside the square brackets.

Column vector:  To create a column vector type the left square bracket [ and then
enter the elements with a semicolon between them, or press the Enter key after
each element. Type the right square bracket ] after the last element.

Tutorial 2-1 shows how the data from Table 2-1 and the coordinates of point

A are used to create row and column vectors.

>> yr=[1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996]

The list of years is assigned to a row vector named yr.

yr =
          1984          1986          1988          1990          1992          1994

>> pop=[127;  130;  136;  145;  158;  178;  211]

The population data is assigned
to a column vector named pop.

The coordinates of point A are assigned
to a column vector called pntAV.
(The Enter key is pressed after each
element is typed.)

Creating a vector with constant spacing by specifying the first term, the spacing,
and the last term:

In  a  vector  with  constant  spacing,  the  difference  between  the  elements  is  the
same. For example, in the vector  v = 2  4  6  8  10, the spacing between the ele-
ments is 2. A vector in which the first term is m, the spacing is q, and the last
term is n is created by typing:

variable_name = [m:q:n]

or

variable_name = m:q:n

(The brackets are optional.)

Some examples are:

>> x=[1:2:13]

First element 1, spacing 2, last element 13.

x =
     1     3     5     7     9    11    13

>> y=[1.5:0.1:2.1]

First element 1.5, spacing 0.1, last element 2.1.

y =

      1.5000      1.6000      1.7000      1.8000      1.9000      2.0000
2.1000

>> z=[-3:7]

First element –3, last term 7.
If spacing is omitted, the default is 1.

z =
    -3    -2    -1     0     1     2     3     4     5     6

>> xa=[21:-3:6]

First element 21, spacing –3, last term 6.

If the numbers m, q, and n are such that the value of n cannot be obtained by
adding q’s to m, then (for positive n) the last element in the vector will be the last
number that does not exceed n.

If only two numbers (the first and the last terms) are typed (the spacing is omit-
ted), then the default for the spacing is 1.

Creating a vector with linear (equal) spacing by specifying the first and last terms,
and the number of terms:

A vector with n elements that are linearly (equally) spaced in which the first ele-
ment  is  xi  and  the  last  element  is  xf  can  be  created  by  typing  the  linspace
command (MATLAB determines the correct spacing):

variable_name = linspace(xi,xf,n)

When the number of elements is omitted, the default is 100. Some examples are:

>> va=linspace(0,8,6)

6 elements, first element 0, last element 8.

va =
      0    1.6000    3.2000    4.8000    6.4000    8.0000

>> vb=linspace(30,10,11)

11 elements, first element 30, last element 10.

vb =
    30   28   26   24    22    20    18    16    14    12    10

>> u=linspace(49.5,0.5)

First element 49.5, last element 0.5.

When the number of elements is
omitted, the default is 100.

u =
  Columns 1 through 10
