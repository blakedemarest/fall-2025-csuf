>> C=[4 2 6; -2 8 10; 6 2 3];

Solving the form XC = D.

>> D=[8 4 0];

>> Xc=D/C

Solving by using right division: X = D/C.

Xc =
   -1.8049    0.2927    2.6341

>> Xd=D*inv(C)

Solving by using the inverse of C: X=DC-1.

3.4 ELEMENT-BY-ELEMENT OPERATIONS

In Sections 3.2 and 3.3 it was shown that when the regular symbols for multipli-
cation and division (* and /) are used with arrays, the mathematical operations
follow  the  rules  of  linear  algebra.  There  are,  however,  many  situations  that
require  element-by-element  operations.  These  operations  are  carried  out  on
each of the elements of the array (or arrays). Addition and subtraction are by
definition  already  element-by-element  operations,  since  when  two  arrays  are
added (or subtracted) the operation is executed with the elements that are in the
same  position  in  the  arrays.  Element-by-element  operations  can  be  done  only
with arrays of the same size.

Element-by-element multiplication, division, or exponentiation of two vec-
tors or matrices is entered in MATLAB by typing a period in front of the arith-
metic operator.

If two vectors a and b are a=[a1 a2 a3 a4] and b=[b1 b2 b3 b4], then element-
by-element multiplication, division, and exponentiation of the two vectors gives:

>> A*B

Element-by-element exponen-
tiation of array B. The result
is an array in which each term
is the corresponding term in B
raised to the power of 3.

Trying to multiply A*B gives
an error, since A and B cannot
be multiplied according to lin-
ear algebra rules. (The number
of columns in A is not equal to
the number of rows in B.)

Inner matrix dimensions must agree.

Element-by-element calculations are very useful for calculating the value of
a function at many values of its argument. This is done by first defining a vector
that contains values of the independent variable, and then using this vector in
element-by-element computations to create a vector in which each element is the
corresponding value of the function. One example is:

>> x=[1:8]

Create a vector x with eight elements.

x =
   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

>> y=x.^2-4*x

y =
  -3  -4  -3   0   5  12  21  32
>>

Vector x is used in element-
by-element calculations of
the elements of vector y.

. Element-by-element operation is needed when
In the example above
x is squared. Each element in the vector y is the value of y that is obtained when
the value of the corresponding element of the vector x is substituted in the equa-
tion. Another example is:

>> z=[1:2:11]

Create a vector z with six elements.

z =
    1    3    5    7    9   11

>> y=(z.^3 + 5*z)./(4*z.^2 - 10)

Vector z is used in element-
by-element calculations of
the elements of vector y.

 y =
   -1.0000    1.6154    1.6667    2.0323    2.4650    2.9241

In the last example

. Element-by-element operations are used in this

example three times: to calculate z3 and z2, and to divide the numerator by the
denominator.
