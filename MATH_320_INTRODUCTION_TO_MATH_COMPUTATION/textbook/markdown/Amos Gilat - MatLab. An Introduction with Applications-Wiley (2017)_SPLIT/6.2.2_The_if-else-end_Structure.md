    Pay=Pay+(t-40)*0.5*h;

end

fprintf('The worker''s pay is  $ %5.2f',Pay)

Application of the program (in the Command Window) for two cases is shown
below (the file was saved as Workerpay):

>> Workerpay

Please enter the number of hours worked  35

Please enter the hourly wage in $  8

The worker’s pay is  $ 280.00

>> Workerpay

Please enter the number of hours worked  50

Please enter the hourly wage in $  10

The worker’s pay is  $ 550.00

6.2.2 The if-else-end Structure

The if-else-end structure provides a means for choosing one group of com-
mands, out of a possible two groups, for execution. The if-else-end struc-
ture is shown in Figure 6-2. The figure shows how the commands are typed in
the program, and includes a flowchart that illustrates the flow, or the sequence,
