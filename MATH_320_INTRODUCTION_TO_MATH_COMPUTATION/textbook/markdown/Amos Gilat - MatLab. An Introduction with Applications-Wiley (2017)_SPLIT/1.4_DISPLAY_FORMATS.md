Chapter 1: Starting with MATLAB

1.3.2 Using MATLAB as a Calculator

The simplest way to use MATLAB is as a calculator. This is done in the Com-
mand Window by typing a mathematical expression and pressing the Enter key.
MATLAB calculates the expression and responds by displaying ans =  followed
by the numerical result of the expression in the next line. This is demonstrated in
Tutorial 1-1.

Tutorial 1-1: Using MATLAB as a calculator.

>> 7+8/2

ans =
    11

>> (7+8)/2

ans =
    7.5000

>> 4+5/3+2

ans =
    7.6667

>> 5^3/2

ans =
   62.5000

>> 27^(1/3)+32^0.2

ans =
     5

>> 27^1/3+32^0.2

ans =
    11

Type and press Enter.

8/2 is executed first.

Type and press Enter.

7+8 is executed first.

5/3 is executed first.

5^3 is executed first, /2 is executed next.

1/3  is  executed  first,  27^(1/3)  and  32^0.2  are
executed next, and + is executed last.

27^1  and  32^0.2  are  executed  first,  /3  is  exe-
cuted next, and + is executed last.

>> 0.7854-(0.7854)^3/(1*2*3)+0.785^5/(1*2*3*4*5)...
-(0.785)^7/(1*2*3*4*5*6*7)

ans =
    0.7071

1.4 DISPLAY FORMATS

Type  three  periods  ...  (and  press  Enter)  to
continue the expression on the next line.

The  last  expression  is  the  first  four
terms of the Taylor series for sin( /4).

The  user  can  control  the  format  in  which  MATLAB  displays  output  on  the
screen. In Tutorial 1-1, the output format is fixed-point with four decimal digits
(called short), which is the default format for numerical values. The format can

be changed with the format command. Once the format command is entered,
all  the  output  that  follows  is  displayed  in  the  specified  format.  Several  of  the
available formats are listed and described in Table 1-2.

MATLAB  has  several  other  formats  for  displaying  numbers.  Details  of
these formats can be obtained by typing help format in the Command Win-
dow. The format in which numbers are displayed does not affect how MATLAB
computes and saves numbers.

format compact Eliminates blank lines to allow more lines with informa-

tion displayed on the screen.

format loose

Adds blank lines (opposite of compact).
