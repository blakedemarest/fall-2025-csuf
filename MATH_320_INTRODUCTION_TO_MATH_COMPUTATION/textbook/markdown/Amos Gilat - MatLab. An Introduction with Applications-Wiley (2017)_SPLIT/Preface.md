Chapter 1
Starting with
MATLAB

This chapter begins by describing the characteristics and purpose of the differ-
ent windows in MATLAB. Next, the Command Window is introduced in detail.
The chapter shows how to use MATLAB for arithmetic operations with scalars
in much to the way that a calculator is used. This includes the use of elementary
math functions with scalars. The chapter then shows how to define scalar vari-
ables (the assignment operator) and how to use these variables in arithmetic cal-
culations. The last section in the chapter introduces script files. It shows how to
write, save, and execute simple MATLAB programs.

1.1  STARTING MATLAB, MATLAB WINDOWS

It is assumed that the software is installed on the computer, and that the user
can start the program. Once the program starts, the MATLAB desktop window
opens with the default layout, Figure 1-1. The layout has a Toolstrip at the top,
the Current Folder Toolbar below it, and four windows underneath. At the top
of the Toolstrip there are three tabs: HOME, PLOTS, and APPS. Clicking on
the tabs changes the icons in the Toolstrip. Commonly, MATLAB is used with
the  HOME  tab  selected.  The  associated  icons  are  used  for  executing  various
commands,  as  explained  later  in  this  chapter.  The  PLOTS  tab  can  be  used  to
create plots, as explained in Chapter 5 (Section 5.12), and the APPS tab can be
used for opening additional applications and Toolboxes of MATLAB.
The default layout
The default layout (Figure 1-1) consists of the following four windows that are
displayed under the Toolstrip: the Command Window (the larger window), the
Current  Folder  Window  (on  the top  left), the  Details  Window  and the  Work-
space  Window  (on  the  bottom  lest).  A  list of  several  MATLAB  windows  and
their purposes is given in Table 1-1.

Four of the windows—the Command Window, the Figure Window, the Edi-
tor Window, and the Help Window—are used extensively throughout the book
