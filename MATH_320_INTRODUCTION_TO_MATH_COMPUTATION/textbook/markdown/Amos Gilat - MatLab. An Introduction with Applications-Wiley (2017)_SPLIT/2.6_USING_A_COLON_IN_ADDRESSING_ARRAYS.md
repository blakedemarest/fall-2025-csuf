Chapter 2: Creating Arrays

2.6 USING A COLON  :  IN ADDRESSING ARRAYS

A colon can be used to address a range of elements in a vector or a matrix.
For a vector:

va(:)   Refers to all the elements of the vector va (either a row or a column vec-
tor).

va(m:n)   Refers to elements m through n of the vector va.
Example:

>> v=[4 15 8 12 34 2 50 23 11]

A vector v is created.

v =
     4    15     8    12    34     2    50    23    11

>> u=v(3:7)

u =
     8    12    34     2    50
>>

For a matrix:

A vector u is created from the ele-
ments 3 through 7 of vector v.

A(:,n) Refers to the elements in all the rows of column n of the matrix A.

A(n,:) Refers to the elements in all the columns of row n of the matrix A.

A(:,m:n) Refers to the elements in all the rows between columns m and n of the

matrix A.

A(m:n,:) Refers to the elements in all the columns between rows m and n of the

matrix A.

A(m:n,p:q) Refers to the elements in rows m through n and columns p through q

of the matrix A.

The use of the colon symbol in addressing elements of matrices is demon-

strated in Tutorial 2-3.

Tutorial 2-3: Using a colon in addressing arrays.

>> A=[1 3 5 7 9 11; 2 4 6 8 10 12; 3 6 9 12 15 18; 4 8 12 16
20 24; 5 10 15 20 25 30]

A =
     1     3     5     7     9    11
     2     4     6     8    10    12
     3     6     9    12    15    18
     4     8    12    16    20    24
     5    10    15    20    25    30

>> B=A(:,3)

Define a matrix A with
5 rows and 6 columns.

Define a column
vector B from the
elements in all of
the rows of column
3 in matrix A.

Define a row vector C from the
elements in all of the columns of
row 2 in matrix A.

Define a matrix E from the ele-
ments in rows 2 through 4 and
all the columns in matrix A.

>> F=A(1:3,2:4)

F =
     3     5     7
     4     6     8

Create a matrix F from the ele-
ments in rows 1 through 3 and col-
umns 2 through 4 in matrix A.

In Tutorial 2-3 new vectors and matrices are created from existing ones by
using a range of elements, or a range of rows and columns (using :). It is possi-
ble,  however,  to  select  only  specific  elements,  or  specific  rows  and  columns  of
existing variables to create new variables. This is done by typing the selected ele-
ments or rows or columns inside brackets, as shown below:

>> v=4:3:34

Create a vector v with 11 elements.

v =
    4    7   10   13   16   19   22   25   28   31   34

>> u=v([3,  5,  7:10])

Create a vector u from the 3rd, the 5th,
and the 7th through 10th elements of v.

u =
    10   16   22   25   28   31

>> A=[10:-1:4; ones(1,7); 2:2:14; zeros(1,7)]

A =
   10    9    8    7    6    5    4
    1    1    1    1    1    1    1
    2    4    6    8   10   12   14
    0    0    0    0    0    0    0

>> B = A([1,3],[1,3,5:7])

Create a

 matrix A.

Create a matrix B from
the 1st and 3rd rows, and
1st, 3rd, and the 5th
through 7th columns of A.
