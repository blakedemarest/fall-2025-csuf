Chapter 3: Mathematical Operations with Arrays

3.1 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION

The operations + (addition) and â€“ (subtraction) can be used to add (subtract)
arrays  of  identical  size  (the  same  numbers  of  rows  and  columns)  and  to  add
(subtract) a scalar to an array. When two arrays are involved the sum, or the dif-
ference, of the arrays is obtained by adding, or subtracting, their corresponding
elements.

In general, if A and B are two arrays (for example,

 matrices),

then the matrix that is obtained by adding A and B is:

  and

Examples are:

>> VectA=[8 5 4]; VectB=[10 2 7];

Define two vectors.

>> VectC=VectA+VectB

VectC =
    18     7    11

>> A=[5 -3 8; 9 2 10]

A =
     5    -3      8
     9     2     10

>> B=[10 7 4; -11 15 1]

B =
    10      7     4
   -11     15     1

Define a vector VectC that is
equal to VectA+VectB.

Define two

 matrices A and B.

>> A-B

Subtracting matrix B from matrix A.

ans =
     -5   -10     4
     20   -13     9

>> C=A+B

C =
    15     4    12
    -2    17    11

>> VectA+A

Define a matrix C that is equal to A+B.
