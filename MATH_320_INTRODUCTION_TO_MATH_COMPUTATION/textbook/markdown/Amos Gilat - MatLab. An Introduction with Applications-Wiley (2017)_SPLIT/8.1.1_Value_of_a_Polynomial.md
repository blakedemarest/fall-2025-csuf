A constant (e.g.,

) is a polynomial of degree 0.
In MATLAB, polynomials are represented by a row vector in which the ele-

the  x  with  the  highest  power.  The  vector  has  to  include  all  the  coefficients,
including the ones that are equal to 0. For example:

8.1.1 Value of a Polynomial

The value  of  a  polynomial  at  a  point  x  can  be  calculated  with  the  function
polyval that has the form:

polyval(p,x)

p is a vector with the coef-
ficients of the polynomial.

x is a number, or a variable that
has an assigned value, or a com-
putable expression.

x can also be a vector or a matrix. In such a case the polynomial is calculated
for each element (element-by-element), and the answer is a vector, or a matrix,
with the corresponding values of the polynomial.
