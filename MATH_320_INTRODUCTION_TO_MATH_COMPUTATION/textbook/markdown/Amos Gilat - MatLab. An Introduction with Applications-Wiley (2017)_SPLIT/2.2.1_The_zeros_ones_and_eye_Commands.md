Elements are defined
by mathematical
expressions.

Three variables are defined.

Rows of a matrix can also be entered as vectors using the notation for creat-

ing vectors with constant spacing, or the linspace command. For example:

>> A=[1:2:11; 0:5:25; linspace(10,60,6); 67 2 43 68 4 13]
A =
     1      3      5      7      9    11
     0      5     10     15     20    25
    10     20     30     40     50    60
    67      2     43     68      4    13
>>

In this example the first two rows were entered as vectors using the notation of
constant  spacing,  the  third  row  was  entered  using  the  linspace  command,
and in the last row the elements were entered individually.

2.2.1 The zeros, ones and, eye Commands

The zeros(m,n), ones(m,n), and eye(n) commands can be used to create
matrices  that  have  elements  with  special  values.  The  zeros(m,n)  and  the
ones(m,n) commands create a matrix with m rows and n columns in which all
elements are the numbers 0 and 1, respectively. The eye(n) command creates a
square  matrix  with  n  rows  and  n  columns  in  which  the  diagonal  elements  are
equal to 1 and the rest of the elements are 0. This matrix is called the identity
matrix. Examples are:

>> zr=zeros(3,4)
zr =
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
>> ne=ones(4,3)
