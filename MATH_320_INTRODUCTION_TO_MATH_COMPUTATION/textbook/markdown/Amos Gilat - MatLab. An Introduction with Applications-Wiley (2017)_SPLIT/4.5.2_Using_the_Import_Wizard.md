Chapter 4: Using Script Files and Managing Data

The  spreadsheet  is  saved  in  a  file  named  TestData1  in  a  disk  in  drive  A.
After  the  Current  Directory  is  changed  to  drive  A,  the  data  is  imported  into
MATLAB by assigning it to the variable DATA:

>> DATA = xlsread('TestData1')

DATA =

 11.0000   2.0000  34.0000  14.0000  -6.0000        0   8.0000
 15.0000   6.0000 -20.0000   8.0000   0.5600  33.0000   5.0000
  0.9000  10.0000   3.0000  12.0000 -25.0000  -0.1000   4.0000
 55.0000   9.0000   1.0000  -0.5550  17.0000   6.0000 -30.0000

4.5.2 Using the Import Wizard

Using the Import Wizard is probably the easiest way to import data into MAT-
LAB since the user does not have to know, or to specify, the format of the data.
The Import Wizard is activated by selecting Import Data in the File menu of the
Command Window. (It can also be started by typing the command uiimport.)
The  Import Wizard starts by displaying  a file selection box that shows all the
data files recognized by the Wizard. The user then selects the file that contains
the data to be imported, and clicks Open. The Import Wizard opens the file and
displays a portion of the data in a preview box so that the user can verify that
the data is the correct choice. The Import Wizard tries to process the data, and if
the wizard is successful, it displays the variables it has created with a portion of
the data. The user clicks next and the wizard shows the Column Separator that
was used. If the variable has the correct data, the user can proceed with the wiz-
ard (click next); otherwise the user can choose a different Column Separator. In
the next window the wizard shows the name and size of the variable to be cre-
ated in MATLAB.  (When  the data is  all  numerical, the  variable  in  MATLAB
has the same name as the file from which the data was imported.) When the wiz-
ard ends (click finish), the data is imported to MATLAB.

As an example, the Import Wizard is used to import numerical ASCII data
saved in a .txt file. The data saved with the file name TestData2 is shown in Fig-
ure 4-8.

The display of the Import Wizard during the import process for the TestData2
file is shown in Figures 4-9 and 4-10. Figure 4-10 shows that the name of the
variable in MATLAB is TestData2 and its size is

In the Command Window of MATLAB, the imported data can be displayed by
typing the name of the variable.

TestData2 =
