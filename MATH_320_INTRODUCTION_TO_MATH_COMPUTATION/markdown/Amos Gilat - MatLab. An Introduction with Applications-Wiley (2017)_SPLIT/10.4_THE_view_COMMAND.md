10.4  The view Command

333

• Convert the polar coordinates grid to a grid in Cartesian coordinates. This can
be done with MATLAB’s built-in function pol2cart (see example below).

• Make a 3-D plot using the values of z and the Cartesian coordinates.

For example, the following script creates a plot of the function
domain

 and

.

z

r=

 over the

[th,r]=meshgrid((0:5:360)*pi/180,0:.1:2);

Z=r.*th;

[X,Y] = pol2cart(th,r);

mesh(X,Y,Z)

Type surf(X,Y,Z) for surface plot.

10.4 THE view COMMAND

The view command controls the direction from which the plot is viewed. This
is  done  by  specifying  a  direction  in  terms  of  azimuth  and  elevation  angles,  as
seen  in  Figure  10-3,  or  by  defining  a  point  in  space  from  which  the  plot  is
viewed. To set the viewing angle of the plot, the view command has the form:

view(az,el)  or    view([az,el])

• az  is  the  azimuth,  which  is  an  angle  (in  degrees)  in  the  x  y  plane  measured
relative  to  the  negative  y  axis  direction  and  defined  as  positive  in  the
counterclockwise direction.

• el is the angle of elevation (in degrees) from the x y plane. A positive value cor-

responds to opening an angle in the direction of the z axis.

• The default view angles are az = –37.5°, and el = 30°.

As an example, the surface plot from Table 10-1 is plotted again in Figure 10-4,
with viewing angles az = 20° and el = 35°.

• With  the  choice  of  appropriate  azimuth  and  elevation  angles,  the  view  com-
mand can be used to plot projections of 3-D plots on various planes according
to the following table:

An example of a top view is shown next. Figure 10-5 shows the top view of the
function that is plotted in Figure 10-1. Examples of projections onto the x z and
y  z  planes  are  shown  next,  in  Figures  10-6  and  10-7,  respectively.  The  figures
show mesh plot projections of the function plotted in Table 10-1.
