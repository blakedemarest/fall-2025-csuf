1.3 ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS WITH SCALARS

In  this  chapter  we  discuss  only  arithmetic  operations  with  scalars,  which  are
numbers. As will be explained later in the chapter, numbers can be used in arith-
metic calculations directly (as with a calculator) or they can be assigned to vari-
ables, which can subsequently be used in calculations. The symbols of arithmetic
operations are:

Operation

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Right division

Left division

Exponentiation

Symbol

Example

+

–

*

/

\

^

5 + 3

5 – 3

5 * 3

5 / 3

5 \ 3 = 3 / 5

5 ^ 3 (means 53 = 125)

It should be pointed out here that all the symbols except the left division are
the same as in most calculators. For scalars, the left division is the inverse of the
right  division.  The  left  division,  however,  is  mostly  used  for  operations  with
arrays, which are discussed in Chapter 3.

1.3.1 Order of Precedence

MATLAB  executes  the  calculations  according  to  the  order  of  precedence  dis-
played below. This order is the same as used in most calculators.

Precedence

Mathematical Operation

First

Second

Third

Fourth

Parentheses. For nested parentheses, the innermost
are executed first.

Exponentiation.

Multiplication, division (equal precedence).

Addition and subtraction.

In an expression that has several operations, higher-precedence operations
are executed before lower-precedence operations. If two or more operations have
the same precedence, the expression is executed from left to right. As illustrated
in the next section, parentheses can be used to change the order of calculations.
