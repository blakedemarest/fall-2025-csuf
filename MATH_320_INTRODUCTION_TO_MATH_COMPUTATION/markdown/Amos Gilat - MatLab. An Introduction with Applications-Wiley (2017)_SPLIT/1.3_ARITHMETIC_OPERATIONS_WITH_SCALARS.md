1.3 ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS WITH SCALARS

In  this  chapter  we  discuss  only  arithmetic  operations  with  scalars,  which  are
numbers. As will be explained later in the chapter, numbers can be used in arith-
metic calculations directly (as with a calculator) or they can be assigned to vari-
ables, which can subsequently be used in calculations. The symbols of arithmetic
operations are:

Operation

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Right division

Left division

Exponentiation

Symbol

Example

+

–

*

/

\

^

5 + 3

5 – 3

5 * 3

5 / 3

5 \ 3 = 3 / 5

5 ^ 3 (means 53 = 125)

It should be pointed out here that all the symbols except the left division are
the same as in most calculators. For scalars, the left division is the inverse of the
right  division.  The  left  division,  however,  is  mostly  used  for  operations  with
arrays, which are discussed in Chapter 3.

1.3.1 Order of Precedence

MATLAB  executes  the  calculations  according  to  the  order  of  precedence  dis-
played below. This order is the same as used in most calculators.

Precedence

Mathematical Operation

First

Second

Third

Fourth

Parentheses. For nested parentheses, the innermost
are executed first.

Exponentiation.

Multiplication, division (equal precedence).

Addition and subtraction.

In an expression that has several operations, higher-precedence operations
are executed before lower-precedence operations. If two or more operations have
the same precedence, the expression is executed from left to right. As illustrated
in the next section, parentheses can be used to change the order of calculations.

1.3.2 Using MATLAB as a Calculator

The simplest way to use MATLAB is as a calculator. This is done in the Com-
mand Window by typing a mathematical expression and pressing the Enter key.
MATLAB calculates the expression and responds by displaying ans =  followed
by the numerical result of the expression in the next line. This is demonstrated in
Tutorial 1-1.

Tutorial 1-1: Using MATLAB as a calculator.

>> 7+8/2

ans =
    11

>> (7+8)/2

ans =
    7.5000

>> 4+5/3+2

ans =
    7.6667

>> 5^3/2

ans =
   62.5000

>> 27^(1/3)+32^0.2

ans =
     5

>> 27^1/3+32^0.2

ans =
    11

Type and press Enter.

8/2 is executed first.

Type and press Enter.

7+8 is executed first.

5/3 is executed first.

5^3 is executed first, /2 is executed next.

1/3  is  executed  first,  27^(1/3)  and  32^0.2  are
executed next, and + is executed last.

27^1  and  32^0.2  are  executed  first,  /3  is  exe-
cuted next, and + is executed last.

>> 0.7854-(0.7854)^3/(1*2*3)+0.785^5/(1*2*3*4*5)...
-(0.785)^7/(1*2*3*4*5*6*7)

ans =
    0.7071
>>

1.4 DISPLAY FORMATS

Type  three  periods  ...  (and  press  Enter)  to
continue the expression on the next line.

The  last  expression  is  the  first  four
terms of the Taylor series for sin( /4).

The  user  can  control  the  format  in  which  MATLAB  displays  output  on  the
screen. In Tutorial 1-1, the output format is fixed-point with four decimal digits
(called short), which is the default format for numerical values. The format can
