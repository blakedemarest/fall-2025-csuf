Chapter 5: Two-Dimensional Plots

line specifiers following each pair. For example the command

plot(x,y,‘-b’,u,v,‘--r’,t,h,‘g:’)
plots y vs. x with a solid blue line, v vs.u with a dashed red line, and h vs. t with
a dotted green line.

Sample Problem 5-1: Plotting a function and its derivatives

Plot  the  function

,  and  its  first  and  second  derivatives,  for

, all in the same plot.

Solution

The first derivative of the function is:
The second derivative of the function is:
A script file that creates a vector x and calculates the values of y,

.
.

, and

 is:

x=[-2:0.01:4];

y=3*x.^3-26*x+6;

Create vector x with the domain of the function.
Create vector y with the function value at each x.

yd=9*x.^2-26;

ydd=18*x;

Create vector yd with values of the first derivative.
Create vector ydd with values of the second derivative.

plot(x,y,'-b',x,yd,'--r',x,ydd,':k')

Create three graphs, y vs. x, yd vs. x, and ydd vs. x, in the same figure.

The plot that is created is shown in Figure 5-7.

5.3.2 Using the hold on and hold off Commands

To  plot  several  graphs  using  the  hold  on  and  hold  off  commands,  one
graph is plotted first with the plot command. Then the hold on command is
typed. This keeps the Figure Window with the first plot open, including the axis
