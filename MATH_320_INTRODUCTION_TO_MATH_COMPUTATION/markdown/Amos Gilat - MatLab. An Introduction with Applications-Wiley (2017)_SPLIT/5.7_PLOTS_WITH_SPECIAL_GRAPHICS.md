Chapter 5: Two-Dimensional Plots

• The lengths of the four vectors x, y, d, and u must be the same.

• At each point the error bar extends from y(i)-d(i) to y(i)+u(i).

5.7 PLOTS WITH SPECIAL GRAPHICS

All  the  plots  that  have  been  presented  so  far  in  this  chapter  are  line  plots  in
which the data points are connected by lines. In many situations plots with dif-
ferent  graphics  or  geometry  can  present  data  more  effectively.  MATLAB  has
many options for creating a wide variety of plots. These include bar, stairs, stem,
and pie plots and many more. Following are some of the special graphics plots
that  can  be  created  with  MATLAB.  A  complete  list  of  the  plotting  functions
that MATLAB offers and information on how to use them can be found in the
Help Window. In this window first choose “Functions by Category,” then select
“Graphics” and then select “Basic Plots and Graphs” or “Specialized Plotting.”
Bar (vertical and horizontal), stairs, and stem plots are presented in the fol-

lowing charts using the sales data from Section 5.1.1.
