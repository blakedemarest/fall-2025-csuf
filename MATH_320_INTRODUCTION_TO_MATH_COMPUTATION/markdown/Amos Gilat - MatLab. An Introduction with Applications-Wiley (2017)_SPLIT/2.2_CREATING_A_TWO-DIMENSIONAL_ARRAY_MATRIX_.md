2.2 CREATING A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY (MATRIX)

A  two-dimensional  array,  also  called  a  matrix,  has  numbers  in  rows  and  col-
umns. Matrices can be used to store information like the arrangement in a table.
Matrices  play  an  important  role  in  linear  algebra  and  are  used  in  science  and
engineering to describe many physical quantities.

In a square matrix the number of rows and the number of columns is equal.

For example, the matrix

7   4   9
3   8   1
6   5   3

 matrix

is  square,  with  three  rows  and  three  columns.  In  general,  the  number  of  rows
and columns can be different. For example, the matrix:

31   26   14   18    5    30
  3   51   20   11   43   65
28     6   15   61   34   22
14   58     6   36   93     7

 matrix

has four rows and six columns. A
m by n is called the size of the matrix.

 matrix has m rows and n columns, and

A  matrix  is  created  by  assigning  the  elements  of  the  matrix  to  a  variable.
This is done by typing the elements, row by row, inside square brackets [ ]. First
type  the  left  bracket  [    then  type  the  first  row,  separating  the  elements  with
spaces or commas. To type the next row type a semicolon or press Enter. Type
the right bracket ] at the end of the last row.

variable_name=[1st row elements; 2nd row elements; 3rd
              row elements; ... ; last row elements]

The elements that are entered can be numbers or mathematical expressions that
may  include  numbers,  predefined  variables,  and  functions.  All  the  rows  must
have the same number of elements. If an element is zero, it has to be entered as
such.  MATLAB  displays  an  error  message  if  an  attempt  is  made  to  define  an
incomplete matrix. Examples of matrices defined in different ways are shown in
Tutorial 2-2.

Tutorial 2-2: Creating matrices.

>> a=[5  35  43;  4  76  81;  21  32  40]
a =
     5    35    43
     4    76    81
    21    32    40
>> b = [7  2  76  33  8
1  98  6  25  6
5  54  68  9  0]

A semicolon is typed before
a new line is entered.

The Enter key is pressed
before a new line is entered.

b =
     7     2    76    33     8
     1    98     6    25     6
     5    54    68     9     0
>> cd=6; e=3; h=4;
>> Mat=[e, cd*h, cos(pi/3); h^2, sqrt(h*h/cd), 14]
Mat =
    3.0000    24.0000     0.5000
   16.0000     1.6330    14.0000

Elements are defined
by mathematical
expressions.

Three variables are defined.

Rows of a matrix can also be entered as vectors using the notation for creat-

ing vectors with constant spacing, or the linspace command. For example:

>> A=[1:2:11; 0:5:25; linspace(10,60,6); 67 2 43 68 4 13]
A =
     1      3      5      7      9    11
     0      5     10     15     20    25
    10     20     30     40     50    60
    67      2     43     68      4    13
>>

In this example the first two rows were entered as vectors using the notation of
constant  spacing,  the  third  row  was  entered  using  the  linspace  command,
and in the last row the elements were entered individually.

2.2.1 The zeros, ones and, eye Commands

The zeros(m,n), ones(m,n), and eye(n) commands can be used to create
matrices  that  have  elements  with  special  values.  The  zeros(m,n)  and  the
ones(m,n) commands create a matrix with m rows and n columns in which all
elements are the numbers 0 and 1, respectively. The eye(n) command creates a
square  matrix  with  n  rows  and  n  columns  in  which  the  diagonal  elements  are
equal to 1 and the rest of the elements are 0. This matrix is called the identity
matrix. Examples are:

>> zr=zeros(3,4)
zr =
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0
>> ne=ones(4,3)
