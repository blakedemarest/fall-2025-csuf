# 1.5 ELEMENTARY MATH BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS

In addition to basic arithmetic operations, expressions in MATLAB can include
functions. MATLAB has a very large library of built-in functions. A function
has a name and an argument in parentheses. For example, the function that cal-
culates  the  square  root  of  a  number  is  sqrt(x).  Its  name  is  sqrt,  and  the
argument is x. When the function is used, the argument can be a number, a vari-
able  that  has  been  assigned  a  numerical  value  (explained  in  Section  1.6),  or  a
computable expression that can be made up of numbers and/or variables. Func-
tions can also be included in arguments, as well as in expressions. Tutorial 1-2
shows  examples  of  using  the  function  sqrt(x)  when  MATLAB  is  used  as  a
calculator with scalars.

**Tutorial 1-2: Using the sqrt built-in function.**

```matlab
>> sqrt(64)
ans =
     8
```
*Argument is a number.*

```matlab
>> sqrt(50+14*3)
ans =
    9.5917
```
*Argument is an expression.*

```matlab
>> sqrt(54+9*sqrt(100))
ans =
    12
```
*Argument includes a function.*

```matlab
>> (15+600/4)/sqrt(121)
ans =
    15
```
*Function is included in an expression.*

Some  commonly  used  elementary  MATLAB  mathematical  built-in  func-
tions are given in Tables 1-3 through 1-5. A complete list of functions organized
by category can be found in the Help Window.

**Table 1-3: Elementary math functions**

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `sqrt(x)` | Square root. | `>> sqrt(81)`<br>`ans = 9` |
| `nthroot(x,n)` | Real nth root of a real number x. (If x is negative n must be an odd integer.) | `>> nthroot(80,5)`<br>`ans = 2.4022` |
| `exp(x)` | Exponential $e^x$. | `>> exp(5)`<br>`ans = 148.4132` |

**Table 1-3: Elementary math functions (continued)**

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `abs(x)` | Absolute value. | `>> abs(-24)`<br>`ans = 24` |
| `log(x)` | Natural logarithm. Base e logarithm (ln). | `>> log(1000)`<br>`ans = 6.9078` |
| `log10(x)` | Base 10 logarithm. | `>> log10(1000)`<br>`ans = 3.0000` |
| `factorial(x)` | The factorial function $x!$ (x must be a positive integer.) | `>> factorial(5)`<br>`ans = 120` |

**Table 1-4: Trigonometric math functions**

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `sin(x)`, `sind(x)` | Sine of angle x (x in radians), Sine of angle x (x in degrees). | `>> sin(pi/6)`<br>`ans = 0.5000` |
| `cos(x)`, `cosd(x)` | Cosine of angle x (x in radians), Cosine of angle x (x in degrees). | `>> cosd(30)`<br>`ans = 0.8660` |
| `tan(x)`, `tand(x)` | Tangent of angle x (x in radians), Tangent of angle x (x in degrees). | `>> tan(pi/6)`<br>`ans = 0.5774` |
| `cot(x)`, `cotd(x)` | Cotangent of angle x (x in radians), Cotangent of angle x (x in degrees). | `>> cotd(30)`<br>`ans = 1.7321` |

The  inverse  trigonometric  functions  are  asin(x),  acos(x),  atan(x),
acot(x)  for  the  angle  in  radians;  and  asind(x),  acosd(x),  atand(x),
acotd(x) for the angle in degrees. The hyperbolic trigonometric functions are
sinh(x),  cosh(x),  tanh(x),  and  coth(x).  Table  1-4  uses  pi,  which  is
equal to $\pi$ (see Section 1.6.3).
