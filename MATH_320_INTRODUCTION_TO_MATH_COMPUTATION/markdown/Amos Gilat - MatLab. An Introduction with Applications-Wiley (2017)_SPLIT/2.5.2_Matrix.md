2.5 Array Addressing

43

ans =
    23

>> VCT(6)=273

Assign a new value to
the sixth element.

VCT =
    35    46    78    23     5   273    81     3    55

The whole vector is displayed.

>> VCT(2)+VCT(8)
ans =
    49

>> VCT(5)^VCT(8)+sqrt(VCT(7))

Use the vector elements in
mathematical expressions.

ans =
   134

2.5.2 Matrix

The address of an element in a matrix is its position, defined by the row number
and the column number where it is located. For a matrix assigned to a variable
ma, ma(k,p) refers to the element in row k and column p.

For example, if the matrix is:

then ma(1,1) = 3 and ma(2,3) = 10.

As with vectors, it is possible to change the value of just one element of a
matrix  by assigning  a  new value to  that element. Also,  single elements can  be
used like variables in mathematical expressions and functions. Some examples
are:

>> MAT=[3 11 6 5; 4 7 10 2; 13 9 0 8]

Create a

 matrix.

MAT =
     3    11      6     5
     4     7     10     2
    13     9      0     8

>> MAT(3,1)=20

Assign a new value to the (3,1) element.

MAT =
     3    11      6     5
     4     7     10     2
    20     9      0     8

>> MAT(2,4)-MAT(1,2)

Use elements in a mathematical expression.

ans =
    -9
