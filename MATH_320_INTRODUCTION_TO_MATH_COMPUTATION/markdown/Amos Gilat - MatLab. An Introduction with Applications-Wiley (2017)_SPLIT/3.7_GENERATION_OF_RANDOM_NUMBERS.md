3.7 GENERATION OF RANDOM NUMBERS

Simulations of many physical processes and engineering applications frequently
require using a number (or a set of numbers) with a random value. MATLAB
has three commands—rand, randn, and randi—that can be used to assign
random numbers to variables.

The rand command:

The rand command generates uniformly distributed random numbers with val-
ues between 0 and 1. The command can be used to assign these numbers to a
scalar, a vector, or a matrix, as shown in Table 3-2.

Description

Example

rand

rand(1,n)

rand(n)

rand(m,n)

Generates a single ran-
dom number between 0
and 1.

>> rand
ans =
    0.2311

Generates an n-element
row vector of random
numbers between 0 and 1.

n n

Generates an
matrix with random
numbers between 0 and
1.

m n

Generates an
matrix with random
numbers between 0 and
1.

>> a=rand(1,4)
a =
    0.6068    0.4860    0.8913
0.7621

>> b=rand(3)
b =
  0.4565  0.4447  0.9218
  0.0185  0.6154  0.7382
  0.8214  0.7919  0.1763

>> c=rand(2,4)
c =
  0.4057  0.9169  0.8936
0.3529
  0.9355  0.4103  0.0579
0.8132

>> randperm(8)
ans =
   8   2   7   4   3   6
5   1

rand-
perm(n)

Generates a row vector
with n elements that are
random permutation of
integers 1 through n.

Sometimes  there  is  a  need  for  random  numbers  that  are  distributed  in  an
interval other than (0,1), or for numbers that are integers only. This can be done
using mathematical operations with the rand function. Random numbers that
are distributed in a range (a,b) can be obtained by multiplying rand by (b – a)
and adding the product to a:

(b – a)*rand + a

For example, a vector of 10 elements with random values between –5 and 10 can
be created by (a = –5, b = 10):

>> v=15*rand(1,10)-5

v =
   -1.8640    0.6973    6.7499    5.2127    1.9164    3.5174
6.9132   -4.1123    4.0430   -4.2460

The randi command:

The  randi  command  generates  uniformly  distributed  random  integer.  The
command can be used to assign these numbers to a scalar, a vector, or a matrix,
as shown in Table 3-3.

Command

Description

Example

randi(imax)

(imax is an
integer)

randi(imax
,n)

Generates a single ran-
dom number between 1
and imax.

>> a=randi(15)
a =
     9

n n

Generates an
matrix with random inte-
gers between 1 and imax.

>> b=randi(15,3)
b =
     4     8    11
    14     3     8
     1    15     8

randi(imax
,m,n)

m n

Generates an
matrix with random inte-
gers between 1 and imax.

>> c=randi(15,2,4)
c =
     1     1     8    13
    11     2     2    13

The range of the random integers can be set to be between any two integers
  matrix  with

by  typing  [imin  imax]  instead  of  imax.  For  example,  a
random integers between 50 and 90 is created by:

>> d=randi([50 90],3,4)

d =
    57    82    71    75
    66    52    67    61
    84    66    76    67

The randn command:

The randn command generates normally distributed numbers with mean 0 and
standard deviation of 1. The command can be used to generate a single number,
a  vector,  or  a  matrix  in  the  same  way  as  the  rand  command.  For  example,  a

 matrix is created by:

>> d=randn(3,4)

d =
   -0.4326    0.2877     1.1892    0.1746
   -1.6656   -1.1465    -0.0376   -0.1867
    0.1253    1.1909     0.3273    0.7258

The mean and standard deviation of the numbers can be changed by mathemat-
ical operations to have any values. This is done by multiplying the number gen-
erated by the randn function by the desired standard deviation, and adding the
desired mean. For example, a vector of six numbers with a mean of 50 and stan-
dard deviation of 6 is generated by:
