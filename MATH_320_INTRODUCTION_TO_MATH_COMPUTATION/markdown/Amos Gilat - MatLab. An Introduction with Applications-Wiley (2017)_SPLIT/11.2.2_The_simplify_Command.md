Chapter 11: Symbolic Math

>> syms x

>> S=x^3+4*x^2-11*x-30
S =
x^3+4*x^2-11*x-30

>> factor(S)

ans =
(x+5)*(x-3)*(x+2)

Define x as a symbolic variable.

Create the symbolic expression

 and assign it to S.

Use the factor command.

MATLAB returns the expression

.

11.2.2 The simplify Command

The simplify command is a tool for simplifying the form of an expression.
The simplify command uses mathematical operations (addition, multiplica-
tion, rules of fractions, powers, logarithms, etc.) and functional and trigonomet-
ric  identities  to  generate  a  simpler  form  of  the  expression.  The  format  of  the
simplify command is:

simplify(S)

where either S is the name of the
existing expression to be simplified,

or

an expression to be simplified
can be typed in for S.

Two examples are:

>> syms x y

>> S=(x^2+5*x+6)/(x+2)

S =
(x^2+5*x+6)/(x+2)

Define x and y as symbolic variables.

Create the symbolic expression

, and assign it to S.

>> SA = simplify(S)

Use the simplify command to simplify S.

SA =
x+3

MATLAB simplifies the expres-
sion to

3+

x

.

>> simplify((x+y)/(1/x+1/y))

Simplify

.

ans =
x*y

MATLAB simplifies the expression to

xy

).

11.2.3 The pretty Command

The pretty command displays a symbolic expression in a format resembling
the  mathematical  format  in  which  expressions  are  generally  typed.  The  com-
mand has the form

Example:

pretty(S)
