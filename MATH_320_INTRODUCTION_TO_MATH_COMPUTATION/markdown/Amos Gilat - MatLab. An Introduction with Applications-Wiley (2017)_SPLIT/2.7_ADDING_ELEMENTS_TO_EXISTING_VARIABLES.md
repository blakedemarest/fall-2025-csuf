2.7 ADDING ELEMENTS TO EXISTING VARIABLES

A  variable  that  exists  as  a  vector,  or  a  matrix,  can  be  changed  by  adding  ele-
ments to it (remember that a scalar is a vector with one element). A vector (a
matrix with a single row or column) can be changed to have more elements, or it
can be changed to be a two-dimensional matrix. Rows and/or columns can also
be added to an existing matrix to obtain a matrix of different size. The addition
of elements can be done by simply assigning values to the additional elements,
or by appending existing variables.

Adding elements to a vector:

Elements can be added to an existing vector by assigning values to the new ele-
ments. For example, if a vector has 4 elements, the vector can be made longer by
assigning values to elements 5, 6, and so on. If a vector has n elements and a new
value  is  assigned  to  an  element  with  an  address  of  n+2  or  larger,  MATLAB
assigns zeros to the elements that are between the last original element and the
new element. Examples:

>> DF=1:4

DF =
    1    2    3    4

>> DF(5:10)=10:5:35

Define vector DF with 4 elements.

Adding 6 elements starting with the 5th.

DF =
    1    2    3    4   10   15   20   25   30   35

Define vector AD with 3 elements.

>> AD=[5  7  2]

AD =
    5    7    2

>> AD(8)=4

AD =
    5   7   2   0   0   0   0   4

Assign a value to the 8th element.
MATLAB assigns zeros to
the 4th through 7th elements.

>> AR(5)=24

Assign a value to the 5th element of a new vector.

AR =
    0    0    0    0   24
>>

MATLAB assigns zeros to the
1st through 4th elements.

Elements  can  also  be  added  to  a  vector  by  appending  existing  vectors.  Two
examples are:

>> RE=[3  8 1  24];

Define vector RE with 4 elements.

>> GT=4:3:16;

>> KNH=[RE  GT]

Define vector GT with 5 elements.
Define a new vector KNH by
appending RE and GT.

KNH =
    3    8    1   24    4    7   10   13   16

Create a new column vector KNV
by appending RE’ and GT’.

>> KNV=[RE'; GT']

KNV =
     3
     8
     1
    24
     4
     7
    10

Adding elements to a matrix:
Rows and/or columns can be added to an existing matrix by assigning values to
the  new  rows  or  columns.  This  can  be  done  by  assigning  new  values,  or  by
appending existing variables.  This must be  done carefully since the size of the
added rows or columns must fit the existing matrix. Examples are:

>> E=[1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8]

E =
     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8

>> E(3,:)=[10:4:22]

E =
     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
    10    14    18    22

>> K=eye(3)

K =
     1     0     0
     0     1     0
     0     0     1

>> G=[E  K]

Define a

 matrix E.

Add the vector 10 14 18 22
as the third row of E.

Define a

 matrix K.

Append matrix K to matrix E. The num-
bers of rows in E and K must be the same.

G =
     1     2     3     4     1     0     0
     5     6     7     8     0     1     0
    10    14    18    22     0     0     1
