Sample Problem 4-1: Height and surface area of a silo

A  cylindrical  silo  with  radius  r  has  a
spherical  cap  roof  with  radius  R.  The
height  of  the  cylindrical  portion  is  H.
Write a program in a script file that deter-
mines the height H for given values of r, R,
and  the  volume  V.  In  addition,  the  pro-
gram  calculates  the  surface  area  of  the
silo.

Use  the  program  to  calculate  the  height
and surface area of a silo with r = 30 ft, R
=  45  ft,  and  a  volume  of  200,000  ft3.
Assign values for r, R, and V in the Com-
mand Window.

Sample Problem 4-2: Centroid of a composite area

R 60

Write a program in a script file that cal-
culates the coordinates of the centroid of
a composite area. (A composite area can
easily  be  divided  into  sections  whose
centroids are known.) The user needs to
divide  the  area  into  sections  and  know
the  coordinates  of  the  centroid  (two
numbers)  and  the  area  of  each  section
(one  number).  When  the  script  file  is
executed,  it  asks  the  user  to  enter  the
three numbers as a row in a matrix. The
user  enters  as  many  rows  as  there  are
sections. A section that represents a hole
is taken to have a negative area. For out-
put, the program displays the coordinates of the centroid of the composite area.
Use the program to calculate the centroid of the area shown in the figure.

Solution

The area is divided into six sections as shown in the following figure. The total
area  is  calculated  by  adding  the  three  sections  on  the  left  and  subtracting  the
three sections on the right. The location and coordinates of the centroid of each
section are marked in the figure, as well as the area of each section.

The coordinates

 and

Sample Problem 4-3: Voltage divider

When several resistors are connected in an electrical circuit in series, the voltage
across each of them is given by the voltage divider rule:

where vn and Rn are the voltage across resistor n and its resistance, respectively,
  is  the  equivalent  resistance,  and  vs  is  the  source  voltage.  The  power

dissipated in each resistor is given by:

The figure below shows a circuit with seven resistors connected in series.

and the power dissipated in each resistor, in a circuit that has resistors connected
in series. When the script file is executed, it requests that the user first enter the
source voltage and then to enter the resistances of the resistors in a vector. The
program displays a table with the resistance listed in the first column, the volt-
age  across  the  resistor  in  the  second  column,  and  the  power  dissipated  in  the
resistor in the third column. Following the table, the program displays the cur-
rent in the circuit and the total power.
