# MATH 320-01 Homework Information

## Policies

Homework forms an integral part of every math course as it is meant to provide practice to students outside of class. For this class, homework is assigned by chapter via Canvas. Homework problems will be chosen from the textbook problems found at the end of each chapter. Homework will be completed in MATLAB and submitted on Canvas. Please be sure to carefully read, understand, and follow the instructions for each homework assignment. Completing the correct problems in the correct manner will be factored into your homework grade. I will provide a "Homework Template" on Canvas that you can edit and use for all homework assignments!

### Important Details
- Homework due dates will be specified on Canvas!
- Homework will typically be due at 11:59 PM on the due date.
- Your lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
- Please expect at least 3 â€“ 5 business days for homework to be graded.

### Grading Scale
Each assignment will be worth 5 points:
- **0 points**: assignment not completed / not submitted / does not include full name in script file.
- **3 points**: assignment submitted late (within 1 week of original due date) and / or with 3+ errors*.
- **5 points**: assignment submitted on time and mostly correct (only one or two errors).

*Errors can include submitting work for the incorrect problems, submitting an assignment in an incorrect format, submitting incorrect work, etc.

## Completing Homework

Please start the homework for a chapter with your groups during class.

### Steps:
1. Download the provided homework template.
   - Template: `Lastname_Firstname_HW1.m`
2. After chapter 1: edit the appropriate sections (name, date, chapter number, problem numbers, problem parts, etc.).
3. Include full solutions (i.e. code) to the assigned problems.
4. Save your file as `"Lastname_firstname_HW#.m"` (where # is the appropriate chapter number).
5. Submit your MATLAB file to Canvas under the appropriate assignment.

## Things to be Cautious About

- If your name is not clearly present in your script file, it will not be considered your work and will not be graded.
- If the questions are not in order and labeled, you will not receive credit.
- You need to submit all problems even if parts are left blank!
- You should only be submitting one file per homework! If multiple files are submitted, only the latest one will be graded.
- Please complete the homework honestly and use it as a learning/study tool to prepare you for quizzes and exams.
