## Catalog Description

Introduction to problem-solving on the computer using modern interactive software. Numerical and symbolic computation. Variety of problems arising in mathematics, science and engineering. Also serves as preparation for subsequent computer-based courses in mathematical modeling.

## Course Prerequisite / Corequisite

- **Prerequisite:** Successful completion of Math 250B with "C" (2.0) or better.
- **Corequisite:** Math 250B

## Course Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of Math 320, you will:

1. **Develop** skills to use personal computers in solving quantitative problems.
2. **Understand** a variety of problems from mathematics, science, and engineering relevant to areas of research in applied mathematics and industry.
3. **Apply** computer algorithms and coding exercises to mathematical concepts, especially various topics from the four-semester calculus and linear algebra sequences.

## Course Focus

Math 320 is a course designed to introduce students to MATLAB: a programming and numeric computing platform. We will explore MATLAB in detail, starting with its basic structures and features. You will first learn how to write, save, and execute simple MATLAB programs involving basic arithmetic, variables, arrays, plots, etc. The primary goal of Math 320 is for you to become comfortable utilizing conditional statements and / or loops to create more complex codes and function files in MATLAB.

While Math 320 is heavily centered around the MATLAB computer program, remember that it is a math class. Students will be expected to recall information and processes from previous courses, including Algebra, Precalculus, the Calculus series, etc. Throughout the semester, you may find that you know how to solve many problems by hand (using a pencil and paper). Our goal is to utilize the tools and features of MATLAB to translate our problem-solving abilities into a functional MATLAB code / program.

## Course Format ("Flipped")

This is an **in-person** course, meaning we will meet in-person for every scheduled meeting. We will work on the computer in every class meeting; feel free to bring your laptop for lectures and classwork!

Our Math 320 course will loosely follow a "flipped" course style. On average, we will have two class days to cover each chapter of the textbook. There will be a set of guided notes posted to Canvas per chapter.

### Before class: This is your best time to experiment with MATLAB at your own pace!
- Prior to the start of a chapter, read through the notes carefully, highlighting important information.
- Attempt the examples and exercises within the notes on your own.
- Use the textbook and/or the MathWorks website to supplement the notes with more detailed information.
- Take note of any questions, comments, or concerns that you would like to address.

### During class: This is the best time to collaborate and ask questions!
- On "day 1" of a chapter, class will start with a 5-minute group discussion of the notes or an assignment.
  - Assignments may be randomly administered and in-class only!
  - You must be present in class when the assignment is completed, and there will be no make-ups!
- Afterwards, you will have 45 – 50 minutes to try a set of exercises with your group members.
- Before class ends, we will go over 1 or 2 exercises as a class (depending on what time permits).
  - At this time, you will be asked to put your laptops / computers away, and I kindly ask that you do not take pictures of any solutions being shared during class.
- On "day 2" of a chapter, you will use class time to complete homework assignments with your group.

### After class: This is the best time to solidify your understanding!
- Revisit the notes and check your understanding of the material.
- Complete homework problems that you didn't have time to complete in class.
- Continue to practice any exercises that you didn't have time to complete in class.

## Class Participation & Attendance Policy

Actively attending class and being open to participation is necessary to the learning process. Although attendance is not "mandatory," I highly recommend that you attend every class meeting! If you are late, please enter quietly and be respectful of the class environment. **If you miss a class meeting, it is your responsibility to contact a fellow classmate to retrieve any information you may have missed.** I recommend asking at least two classmates for their contact information!

**Any absence during the first two weeks of class may result in your being dropped from the course.**

## Student Office Hours

Student hours are your time to ask questions about anything and everything, such as homework problems, quizzes, exams, class notes, etc. If you are unable to attend my scheduled student hours, you can always email me to set up your own appointment! You can request to meet in-person or via Zoom. **I do not hold office hours or accept appointments on holidays and no-class days!**

## Course Evaluation & Grading

Grade percentages will be determined by a weighted combination of discussions and homework, quizzes, two midterm exams, and one cumulative final exam. Course grades will be posted via Canvas and will be updated as regularly as possible! The grading period will end on the day of the final exam.

The weights for each category are:

| Category | Homework | Quizzes | Midterm Exams | Final Exam | Total |
|----------|----------|---------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Weight | 15% | 15% | 40% | 30% | 100% |

Using your overall weighted percentage, letter grades will be determined as follows:

| Grade | Percentage | Grade | Percentage | Grade | Percentage | Grade | Percentage |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|-------|------------|
| A+ | 97% – 100% | B+ | 87% – 89.9% | C+ | 77% – 79.9% | D | 60% – 69.9% |
| A | 90% – 96.9% | B | 80% – 86.9% | C | 70% – 76.9% | F | 0% – 59.9% |

**For any and all assignments submitted for this course, your full name must be present at the top of the file to receive credit! No name, no grade! You will be given a chance to re-submit!**

### Homework

Homework forms an integral part of every math course as it is meant to provide practice to students outside of class. For this class, homework is assigned by chapter via Canvas. Homework problems will be chosen from the textbook problems found at the end of each chapter. Homework will be completed in MATLAB and submitted on Canvas. Please be sure to carefully read, understand, and follow the instructions for each homework assignment. Completing the correct problems in the correct manner will be factored into your homework grade. I will provide a "Homework Template" on Canvas that you can edit and use for all homework assignments!

- Homework due dates will be specified on Canvas!
- Homework will typically be due at 11:59 PM on the due date.
- Each assignment will be worth 5 points:
  - **0 points:** assignment not completed / not submitted / does not include full name in script file.
  - **3 points:** assignment submitted late (within 1 week of original due date) and / or with 3+ errors*.
  - **5 points:** assignment submitted on time and mostly correct (only one or two errors).
- *Errors can include submitting work for the incorrect problems, submitting an assignment in an incorrect format, submitting incomplete / incorrect work, etc.
- Your lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
- Please expect at least 3 – 5 business days for homework to be graded.

### Quizzes

Quizzes are meant to periodically test your understanding of the course material. Quizzes may contain written questions or coding questions (but not both). There will be a total of 5 quizzes throughout the semester. Quizzes will be administered in-person every other Wednesday (except for exam weeks) in the beginning of class. The content covered on each quiz is dependent on the pace of the course and will be announced in class!

## Late Work & Extra Credit Policies

Assignments, quizzes, and exams are designed and assigned with the intention that students will have plenty of time to complete them by the proposed due date. If you feel you are unable to meet a due date, or you believe the due date to be unreasonable, please let me know in a timely manner **before** the assignment is due.

**Please do not expect extra credit opportunities throughout the semester.**

## Teacher-Student Communication & Conduct

I will often use Canvas announcements or email to communicate important messages outside of the classroom. Therefore, please make it a habit to check our Canvas page and your student email daily! **It is highly recommended that your Canvas settings are set to receive notifications for announcements.**

### Email / Canvas Messages

The best way to reach me outside of class is to message me via email or Canvas.
- All messages should be respectful and professionally written, meaning no slang, texting language, etc.
- When sending an email, please use a subject line that clearly indicates your name and what class you are in (ex: Math 320-01 Christine Deeb). This will help me to respond to your email as quickly as possible.
- You may expect a response within 2 business days and during regular business hours (M – F, 9 AM – 5 PM). If I fail to respond to your message within 2 days, please let me know in person or by a follow-up message!

## Classroom Conduct Expectations

To ensure that you gain the most knowledge and have the best possible experience:
- You will often be asked to participate in class by answering questions during lecture, working with the people around you, engaging in thoughtful discussion, etc.
- Please refrain from being on your cellphone during class as it is a distraction to you and others.
- Please remove earpieces and headphones when class starts.
- Please do not talk among yourselves while others are presenting because it causes distraction from the learning process; be respectful to your classmates and your instructor.
- It is in your best interest to attend and be engaged in every class meeting!
- **Please treat this class as a professional work environment! Act professional and respectful to all!**
