### Submitting your Homework
To submit your homework:

Save your file as "Lastname_firstname_HW1.m"
Submit your MATLAB file to Canvas under the appropriate assignment.
Things to be cautious about:
If your name is not clearly present in your script file, it will not be considered your work and will receive a 0.
If the questions are not in order / not labeled appropriately, you will not receive credit.
You need to submit all problems even if parts are left blank!
You should only be submitting one file per homework! If multiple files are submitted, only the latest one will be graded.
