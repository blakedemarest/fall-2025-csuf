## Guidance for Approaching the Trader Joe's Case

This case has two purposes to it – introduce the notion of strategy and introduce the case discussion format. When we discuss the case in the class, we will go through this case a bit slower than subsequent cases. It will also be somewhat open ended in its format, in the sense that we will not drive towards specific learning goals for the first case. This open-ended aspect will allow you to settle into this case discussion pedagogy and get an appreciation for the complexity involved in strategic management.

After preparing for this case, I do not expect you to fully understand what strategy means. It will take the entire course for you to have a comfortable grasp of the concept. All you should be aiming for in this case is the ability to draw connections between the key textbook concepts (as highlighted in the outline above - text in yellow) and different parts of the case. One way to do this is by marking the case with the concept name wherever appropriate.

A basic but useful tool we will be using for the Trader Joe’s Case is the SWOT analysis. Keep in mind that for the SWOT analysis, SW is internal and OT is external. Conduct the SWOT analysis and list the various case facts under each of the four parts of the SWOT. While listing them, think about where they belong and why they belong in a particular part. Some aspects of the case may not easily fit into just one part of the SWOT and these are the types of case facts that we will be debating during the case discussion. So pay more attention to those aspects that you find difficult to classify.

## Guidance Questions for the Trader Joe's Case

Guidance questions are meant to provoke a thought process. Ponder over them, especially when the answers are not evident. Remember, in a case discussion there are **no right answers but only better answers**.

**Elements/attributes of a strategy**

1. Identify elements and attributes of the Trader Joe’s strategy that relate to the concepts highlighted in the Topic Outline, above.
2. How does Trader Joe’s strategy measure up in terms of the four key attributes of a strategic management process?
   1. What aspects would you consider as having long-term vs short-term implication?
   2. Who are the key stakeholders in this case? What role do they play in Trader Joe’s strategic management process?

**Strategy as a concept**

1. Intended vs realized strategy
   1. What do you think is Trader Joe’s intended strategy?
   2. How would you describe Trader Joe’s realized strategy?
   3. Do you see any disconnects between the intended and realized strategies and why?
2. Strategic coherence
   1. Do you think the strategy changed after ownership (Aldi North) or leadership change (John Shields); and why?
   2. Is there coherence in Trader Joe’s strategic direction? Justify your answer.
   3. Do you think focusing on people is a strategy or is it simply a marketing ploy/PR stunt?
   4. Do you think the secrecy aspects hinder or enable strategic coherence? Why?

**SWOT**

1. Conduct a SWOT analysis and list the various aspects from the case under each part – Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Consider things such as:
   - Secrecy
   - Aisles
   - No major brands
   - Small footprint
   - Own brands
   - Low variety
   - Target market
   - Lack of official info
   - No coupons
   - Low ads
   - Newsletter
   - Extroverted employees
