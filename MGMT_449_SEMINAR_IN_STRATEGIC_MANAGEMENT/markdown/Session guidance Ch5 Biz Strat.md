## Guidance for Approaching the De Beers Case

The De Beers case will be used for two different topics. For each topic, use the relevant concepts for analyzing the case.

With De Beers and the related topic of business strategy, we are moving from strategic analysis into the strategy formulation part of the strategic management process. This is where we assess the impact of the major decisions or changes in strategic direction that the firm undertakes in terms of its overall position in the industry/market segment. As mentioned in the chapter outline above, this session considers what you can potentially decide based on the five forces and value chain. In other words, the 5-forces and value chain will be the analyses, and generic strategies will be the subsequent formulation of strategy. Please, revisit Porter's five forces and Value chain analysis utilizing the book and lecture ppt. In this session, we are also considering how to 'sustain' the competitive adv. and not just how to gain competitive adv. We apply these principles for our case analysis as well.

Our case discussion will proceed through the following stages; you can do the same for your analysis.

1. Factors that are driving the change in strategy from Old to New
   1. Relate the forces of change to various concepts from Porter’s five forces, such as barriers to entry, concentrated buyers etc.
   2. Study the diamond value chains that are already provided in the case (Exhibit 1). Analyze how and why Lev Leviev poses a threat in terms of the value chain.
2. Factors that are likely to help De Beers succeed with the new strategy
   1. Relate the NEW strategy (page 9) with the most appropriate generic strategy type that can help De Beers succeed. In other words, try to fit the New strategy within the following categories – Overall cost leadership; Broad differentiation; Focus (Cost or Differentiation). Think of the reasoning for your categorization.
   2. You can also consider what generic strategy De Beers ‘should’ be following given all the threats it faces.
   3. Analyze how specific characteristics of a generic strategy you have selected will help overcome some of the forces identified before.
   4. Consider how you can relate generic strategies to corporate social responsibility.
