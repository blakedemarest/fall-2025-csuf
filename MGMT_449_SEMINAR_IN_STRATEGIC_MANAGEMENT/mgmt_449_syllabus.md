### COURSE DESCRIPTION

**Catalog description:** Integrative cases from top management viewpoint. Analyze the firm's internal and external environment. Formulate strategic decisions to develop and sustain competitive advantage. Implement strategic decisions, organization design and control.

This course provides a glimpse into the strategic management process. It is just a 'glimpse' and not a deep dive because this is a complex process, and many of the nuances of this process are unique to a specific firm and hidden from an outsider's perspective. This course is also a 'glimpse' because strategy is not a formula that reveals itself once you open the assigned textbook. If business strategy were to be a formula and if everyone could memorize that formula by taking a strategy course, then every company would be able to figure out a way to beat its competition. Such a scenario, by design, is impossible because if every company can beat its competitor, who are they actually beating?

If you are not learning the secret strategy formula, what are you learning in this course!! This course is all about making sense of ambiguity, dealing with uncertainty, simplifying complex phenomena related to business strategy, and, in the broadest sense it is about **structuring an unstructured problem**. This skill for structuring unstructured problems can only be obtained through diligence. It is very important that from day one, you are oriented towards deep engagement in every aspect of this course and not treat it as a simple read-and-learn. This syllabus is meant to provide as much detail as possible regarding the multi-dimensional nature of this course.

This course incorporates a **Flipped/Blended course design** where lecture videos are provided beforehand, and in-class activities are heavily oriented toward discussions and participation. You are all adults who are most likely about to graduate. So, I expect you to **be self-driven and ready for a corporate career without hand-holding**. Also, your **business career will require you to analyze information (structure unstructured problems)**, think on your own, and articulate your ideas in front of others. This course will force you to **make decisions in ambiguous situations** to simulate such a scenario.

### COURSE MODALITY

All the classes and exams are online. Most of the sessions are synchronous, except where noted in the schedule of classes.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES AND LEARNING GOALS

There are three interrelated and somewhat overlapping learning goals for this course.
- **Understand** concepts/terms related to strategic management through textbook, lecture videos, and conceptual clarification sessions.
- **Identify and apply** the most appropriate concepts in real (or close to real) situations. This goal is mainly achieved through case discussions and group project.
- **Extend** the application of concepts by utilizing your critical thinking. This is achieved mainly through case discussions and group project.

Being continually engaged in the learning process of this course will also help you realize the following: Integrated Perspective; Top Management Perspective; Mastering Analytical Tools; Environmental Awareness; Industry-Specific Knowledge; Professional Skills such as Critical Thinking & Problem Solving Orientation; and Practical and Real World Orientation.

## REQUIRED MATERIAL

1. **Strategic Management: Creating Competitive Advantage**
   - Authors: Dess et al.
   - Publisher: McGraw-Hill
   - ISBN: 9781264654338
   - Edition: 11th ed.
   - **Alternatives:** If you have access to the 9th or 10th ed. you can use them as well. You can also use the variations to this textbook - ISBN: 9781266006883, 9781264124329, or 9781266011832.
   - **Note:** There is no need to buy a brand new textbook. You can buy a used book or rent it new/used from different places including Titan shop, Amazon, and other online bookstores. You can rent either digital or physical books.

2. **Harvard Business School Cases.** The link to our online HBS Case resource is the following:
   
   ### https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1326943
   
   Go to the above URL and register using your Cal State Fullerton email account. Personal emails will not allow you to purchase and download the cases. **NOTE: For some companies there may be multiple cases available on the HBS repository. Purchase only the cases that are specified for this course** (see the Schedule of Classes section of this syllabus). You can purchase the cases either one at a time or in bulk.

## OTHER RESOURCES

**Session guidance document:** To help students focus on the most important parts of a book chapter, a **topic outline** will be provided on Canvas within a **session guidance document**. This outline indicates the sections or subsections that will be covered and, in many instances, will also point towards important concepts. Use this topic outline to focus your efforts and not waste time reading the unnecessary parts of the textbook. If there is an associated case for a particular topic, there will be case-related parts in that session guidance. **No study guide** is going to be provided as that would work against the learning objectives of this course.

**Lecture videos and ppts:** Lecture videos and ppts have been uploaded in the link below. The same link is also available through Canvas.

### https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3wj60m7zeeqaa/AAD0exZE5PLBhqEjFzH_9MRTa?dl=0

Download and save it locally to avoid any internet connection issues at a later time. Because of the size of the lecture videos, the files are typically divided into two or three parts. Use your **CSUF email** to log into the Dropbox account. Only students enrolled in this course section may view the recording. Students may **not** post or use the recordings in any other setting (e.g., social media) for any other purpose. Students who violate this will be subject to **disciplinary action**.

## COURSE COMMUNICATION AND RESPONSE TIME

All course announcements are generally posted on Canvas or sent directly to your CSUF email. You MUST check your CSUF email and Canvas on a regular basis (several times a week) for the duration of the course. Individual emails may be used for specific purposes and the students can provide alternate emails.

I typically respond to emails and Canvas messages within 48 hrs, excluding weekends and holidays. If you do not get a response after 48 hrs, please send me a reminder message. Do not post Canvas comments if you are expecting a response. They are hard to track and will often go unnoticed.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Since most of the classes are held online, it is important to be aware of the following technical requirements. Ensure these before the start of the classes so that you are not left behind and do not face difficulties in achieving the scores that you deserve. Contact our IT department if you are facing any technical challenges.

**Hardware requirements**
1. Laptop or desktop should not be too old. This is to ensure that you do not face issues during our online sessions and during the exams. Phones and tablets may not be sufficient for many of these activities.
2. Microphone and speaker. Since the online sessions involve discussions where everyone is required to participate, ensure that your audio devices are in very good working order.

**Software requirements**
1. **Zoom:** All synchronous class sessions are held on zoom. Please have the latest version of Zoom installed. **Note that the class Zoom link requires CSUF log-in authentication. You cannot log-in anonymously, as a guest, or using some other email.**
2. **Canvas:** This course will use Canvas platform.
3. You are highly encouraged to use **Grammarly** for your essay type assignments and exams. Link: https://www.fullerton.edu/it/students/software/grammarly/
4. **Turnitin:** Written assignments will have Turnitin enabled on Canvas to prevent plagiarism. See the following on how to use it: https://help.turnitin.com/integrity/student/canvas.htm
5. **Proctorio** software is going to be used for exam proctoring. Ensure that you do all the necessary things as indicated here: https://www.fullerton.edu/it/services/software/proctorio/index.php

## CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT

Honest and respectful dialogue is expected. Challenging ideas in a supportive and sensitive manner are encouraged. Hostility and disrespectful behavior are not acceptable. All students are expected to help create an environment conducive to effective teaching and learning for all participants. Behavior that disrupts teaching and learning is unacceptable. Serious or habitual offenses may result in a referral to the Assistant Vice President of Academics, the student conduct system, Campus Safety, and/or Counseling.

**You must always keep your cameras turned on for all online synchronous sessions. The camera must clearly show your face to authenticate the person attending the class.** Exceptions are made only under extreme circumstances or if there are technical issues.

Any disruptive behavior in the online synchronous sessions will lead to ejection from the Zoom session. The student will not be permitted to enter back until the issue has been resolved after discussion.

### Recording prohibition

**Students are prohibited from recording class activities** (including case discussions, office hours, advising sessions, etc.), distributing class recordings, or posting class recordings. This is applicable for both in-person and online sessions. This university policy (330.230) is in place to protect the privacy of students in the course, as well as to maintain academic integrity through reducing the instances of cheating. Students who record, distribute, or post these materials may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct. It is the responsibility of students that require special accommodations or assistive technology due to a disability to notify the instructor and contact DSS.

## POSSIBLE REVISIONS

As much as possible, we will adhere to the details provided in the syllabus. However, there may be circumstances that might necessitate changes in the syllabus. You will be provided with all the details if and when we need to make those changes.

---

## Session Formats

There are three types of sessions in this course - Topic sessions, Special Sessions, and Exams. The **topic** sessions will deal with the main concepts and analytical frameworks related to strategic management processes. Within the **topic** sessions we will have three sub-types: case-based, integrative case and conceptual sessions. Further details of these sessions are provided below.

### TOPIC SESSIONS

We will be following a flipped design for most of the topic session. This means that the sessions will focus on **discussions and not lectures**. In the schedule of classes, the case-based and integrative case topic sessions will have an associated case indicated. For every topic session (case-based and conceptual), lecture videos dealing with concepts from the textbook are provided. Lecture slides are also provided for easy reference. You must read the chapters in advance so that the lecture videos/slides can provide a better understanding of the concepts and analytical frameworks.

#### Case Based Topic Sessions

The case-based topic sessions have pre-class (lecture and concepts) and in-class (case discussion) activities on Zoom. Each of these are described below.

**Pre-class activities**

The following is only a suggested study process. Please tweak this process to suit your own learning style better. You can undertake these steps iteratively. The related session guidance document for the relevant topic can be found on Canvas.

**Before Class:**
1. Read only those textbook parts as indicated in the **Topic outline** in the **session guidance**.
2. Watch the **lecture video**.
3. Read the **case approach** in the session guidance document to understand what to focus on while reading the case.
4. Read the **actual case** (downloaded from the HBS repository) and make relevant notes wherever necessary. Cases have a lot of information and can sometimes be very daunting to analyze. Remember that a particular case has been assigned to a particular topic (book chapter) because we will approach it from the perspective of that topic. So the focus must be on the assigned topic for that particular session.
5. **Make connections with concepts.** This can occur in many different ways:
   - a. Indicate how the case helped you understand certain concepts in the assigned topic
   - b. Explain a particular concept using specific information from the case (case facts)
   - c. Link concepts with case facts by identifying how a particular case fact relates to a particular concept
   - d. Analyze the case or parts of the case using the analytical frameworks or tools provided in the associated topic. Note: not all topics have analytical tools.
   - e. Argue how certain case facts go beyond certain concepts or even deviate from those concepts.
6. Read the **case guidance questions** in the session guidance document after the first read of the case. These questions are meant to trigger a thought process. Do not try to write detailed answers to these questions. Instead, note down your emerging thoughts as short sentences/phrases. Revisit the case to help you answer these guidance questions.
7. Revise your notes and organize your thoughts based on the case approach guidance. You must iterate multiple times between the actual case and the guidance to be adequately prepared for the class.
8. Bring your notes from the textbook, and the case notes for in-class discussion

**In-class activities (Zoom synchronous)**

For the in-class activities, the class time will be divided into three parts: Conceptual re-cap; Case discussion, and Conceptual clarification. The first 15 minutes are used to quickly remind you of the key concepts, analytical tools, or frameworks that relate to the topic. The last 15 minutes of the class will be used to clarify any lingering conceptual questions. You cannot ask broad conceptual clarification questions already answered in the lecture videos. Your questions must be specific and well thought out. Most of the class time will be dedicated to case discussion, elaborated below.

**NOTE: Active participation in case discussions is fundamental in this course. Anyone who is ill-prepared for such active participation is likely not going to succeed in this course. If you face social/psychological barriers to participation, I highly encourage you to come and talk to me.**

We will analyze a specific organization's critical strategic choices and share our thoughts in a Socratic discussion format.

> "Socratic method â€¦ is a form of **cooperative argumentative dialogue** between individuals, based on asking and answering **questions** to stimulate **critical thinking** and to draw out **ideas and underlying presumptions**" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method)

The above definition from Wikipedia is a good starting point for understanding this. I will break down the different parts of this statement so that we are all on the same page.

- **Cooperative** â€“ we are all working towards a common goal of a collective learning experience, even when we may have very different perspectives.
- **Argumentative dialogue** â€“ You are encouraged to challenge each other's logic, not the person. Relatedly, do not completely dismiss other's ideas but build on them by drawing connections and contrasts.
- **Questions** â€“ I will be providing a list of guidance questions to help you prepare for the case before arriving at the class. I will also develop impromptu questions based on the insights you provided during the class discussion. You can ask a 'rhetorical' question that must be followed by your thoughts on how to answer the question.
- **Critical thinking** is the ability to go beyond the obvious without losing touch with logic and facts. It is not an easy skill to understand and learn but I will endeavor to push each and every student towards it.
- **Ideas and underlying presumptions** â€“ Critical thinking is best demonstrated by your ability to communicate ideas and underlying presumptions/assumptions. This also means that simply restating a fact from the case will not be enough.

**After class**

Update your notes with your understanding of the concepts. This will come in handy for the exams.

#### Integrative case session (with sustainability emphasis)

The integrative case sessions will also involve case discussion but utilize more than one topic from the second half (Ch 5,6, & 7). While you will primarily connect with concepts from the second half, you are also allowed to bring in concepts from the first half (ch 1, 2, & 3) as secondary conceptual connections. Aside from what is shared in this section, no session guidance is provided as this will be a 'test' of your ability to 'structure the unstructured problem' and make decisions on your own. While we will not have the conceptual re-cap similar to other case discussions, you will be allowed to ask specific conceptual clarifications after the case discussion.

The integrative case incorporates a "Sustainability focus". Even though we briefly touch upon sustainability within the first chapter, a more in-depth understanding is essential for anyone pursuing a business career. In today's world, concerns related to sustainability are all-pervasive. Relatedly, Business roundtable issued "a new Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation signed by 181 CEOs who commit to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders â€“ customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders" (Aug 2019). This statement was signed be CEOs of some of the largest US companies, including Amazon, Walmart, Apple, and JP Morgan Chase. It signified a tremendous shift away from decades-long shareholder primacy argument. So, understanding the dynamics of perspectives such as sustainability, stakeholder management, and corporate social responsibility becomes extremely important, regardless of the industry or discipline of your business career.

In order to prepare for the case, use the following approach:
1. Revisit the assigned topics and your related notes. You are encouraged to use multiple concepts and frameworks from the chapters assigned. This is also an opportunity to link concepts across topics. Linking concepts across different topics will be considered high-quality comments for this session.
2. Link the concepts and framework with the information provided in the case by conducting some analysis.
3. Do not use Stakeholder Management, Sustainability, or CSR related concepts as your primary analytical tools. That would be a moot point as the whole case would be related to these. Instead, link these concepts with other concepts learned in the course and thus extend their application.

#### Conceptual Topic Sessions

There will be no cases associated with these sessions - Analyzing the external environment (Chapter 2) and Corporate-level strategy (Chapter 6). Even though you do not have to spend time and effort towards case preparation, you are expected to read the related textbook material and view the lecture video before these sessions. Also, keep in mind that these concepts and frameworks will be used in the integrative cases and in some instances, other topic cases discussions. Following are some of the key aspects to keep in mind for the synchronous session:

- The conceptual discussions will be **interactive**.
- You will be asked to **connect concepts with real-life companies as examples**. These should be different from the examples provided in the lecture videos. These connections must be made as part of your preparation process. Also, see the relevant session guidance.
- In the initial part of the session, I will **cold call some students** to explain what they understand about certain **concepts**. Coming in prepared is extremely important to avoid embarrassment.
- You are **allowed to ask broad questions** in this session for further clarification, after the initial round of cold calling.
- There is **no participation score** associated with the conceptual topic sessions, but absence is penalized (see 'Attendance and Late Entry Policy' section).

### SPECIAL SESSIONS

These sessions do not follow the same format as the topic sessions. They are elaborated below.

**Introduction - Synchronous**

Keep in mind that absence during the first class of the course can lead to an administrative drop. Also, attending the intro session is extremely important because you will be provided with a **detailed understanding of what to expect** from this course and **what is expected from you**. You must **read the syllabus before attending the intro session**.

**Conceptual clarification sessions - Synchronous**

During the week prior to the first mid-term exam, there will be an optional session during which you can ask specific conceptual clarification questions. Please do not ask broad questions or questions that are already answered in the lecture videos.

**Group Project Work - Asynchronous**

There will be two group project-related sessions to work on the actual group project. This is an asynchronous session with no Zoom class meeting. However, group members must be available for work during class times using previously agreed communication channels such as Discord, Zoom, Teams, email, text, etc. **Being available for your group during these sessions is mandatory.** Your group project score will be penalized if you are unavailable to your team.

**CBE Assessment â€“ Synchronous**

Details of this assessment are provided later in the syllabus. This is an assessment that is required by the college. Since the assessment is only for 90 minutes, the second half of the class will be used for group project draft feedback. This is an optional exercise, and teams have to book a 20-minute slot in advance by sending an email request.

### PARTICIPATION (24 PTS)

Participation during case discussions is mandatory in this seminar. Participation in class discussion is **not** the same as class attendance. Merely coming to all classes will not influence your class discussion scores. **You can only get participation points based on the comments shared during class discussion.**

**Note: Participation scores are only for case discussions.** While you are encouraged to participate in the conceptual discussions, such participation will not be evaluated and doesn't have any points allocated towards it.

**Assessment aids**

Assessing case participation scores is a very subjective process. I will be using various assessment aids to eliminate as much ambiguity as possible.
1. Your **profile pictures** on Canvas. Please double-check to ensure it is visible.
2. **MANDATORY Case Participation note** on Canvas (explained below).
3. **Class recordings.** By continuing your enrollment in this course, you agree to such recording. These recordings will not be shared with students for various reasons, including legal.

**Allocation of participation scores**

There will be **five case discussions** â€“ four related to specific topics and one integrative (with sustainability emphasis). For each case discussion, you can earn up to four points. The **four participation points** for each case discussion session are determined on the basis of the **distinct comments** shared across different parts of the discussion. A **distinct comment** need not be a single statement. The set of statements around a single core idea must all be considered part of the same comment. If there is a follow-up discussion based on the questions posed by the instructor, then that is considered part of a single comment.

The **quality** of each distinct comment will be assessed based on the following criteria (arranged in ascending order of importance):

**Level 1)** Original opinions, ideas, and thoughts based on case information but not connecting with any particular concept from the assigned topic.

**Level 2)** Original opinions, ideas, and thoughts based on logical connections between a case fact and a concept from the assigned topic (see Schedule of Classes). Many of these facts and concepts might already be shared by others during the discussions, but connecting them in a different way and/or building on the comments already shared is important.

**Level 3)** Making a complex argument in a cohesive and coherent manner. Complex arguments involve multiple case facts and multiple concepts linked logically. Complex arguments are not the same as confusing or verbose arguments. The thought process is complex, but the articulation must be clear, straightforward, and succinct.

**Level 4)** Provide a complex argument (as described above) to support a non-obvious stance or insight. This is where you push the boundaries of your logical reasoning without losing touch with facts and logic (critical thinking).

For each of the comments shared, you will be allocated participation points as follows:

| Points Assigned for every comment | Quality |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| 0.5 | Level 1 |
| 1 | Level 2 |
| 2 | Level 3 |
| 3 | Level 4 |

Cumulatively, you can only earn a maximum of 4 points. For example, if you shared three Level 3 comments, you will get 4 points for that case discussion and not 6 points.

Additionally, you must meet the following expectations, or else you will get a lower score:

- **Do not share more than two Level 1 comments.** If you share more, only two will be considered for grading.
- Upload a **MANDATORY Case Participation note** on Canvas.
  - You need not submit a participation note if you were absent or did not share comments.
  - In these notes, record comments shared during the case discussion.
  - I do not expect you to transcribe everything. A simple phrase or a succinct sentence that indicates what you shared is enough.
  - You can also upload pictures of handwritten notes as long as they are legible.
  - This note per se will not be evaluated.
  - You CANNOT put someone else's comments in these notes, and you CANNOT put something you thought of but couldn't share during the class discussion.
- Follow the **rules of engagement:**
  - Always be respectful
  - Help others understand your stance
  - Before you disagree, always understand the perspective of others.
  - Challenge the ideas without denigrating the person.

Additional aspects to keep in mind regarding the quality of your case discussion:
- Simply restating case information, however important, will not earn any points.
- Listing different unrelated points is not considered complex arguments, and students might be cut short if they appear to be listing without establishing a connection.
- For integrative case discussions, you must utilize concepts/frameworks from at least two allocated topics.
- Frivolous comments will not earn any points.
- In my experience, students who make consistent, well-thought-out, and well-articulated points will naturally create a lasting impression and, hence, are more likely to get a good participation score.
- Those who are reluctant to engage in the class or inadequately prepared will likely gain minimal points. However, I will not hesitate to 'cold-call' students who are regularly silent or make only one or two level 1 comments every class.
- I can also tell if someone is trying to 'wing it' by just listening to and rephrasing what others say. I might undertake a more searching line of follow-up questions if I suspect that a student is trying to wing it without having prepared for the case discussion.

**Overall participation incentive (4 pts)**

In total, 20 points are allocated for participation in the five case discussions. The overall participation incentive is awarded for consistent and high levels of participation across those discussions. **The points earned through make-up written assignments do not count towards this incentive.** The only exception is any synchronous case discussion converted to an asynchronous format due to unforeseen emergencies. Such async classes typically involve submitting a case write-up like the make-up assignment. In such circumstances, the score for the write-up in lieu of the class discussion will be considered for the incentive points.

Since participating scores are directly updated on Canvas with make-up assignment scores (See Case write-up assignments section below), I will keep track of the original in-class participation score offline to calculate this incentive. Incentive points are based on the following criteria:

| Points Assigned | Criteria |
|-----------------|----------|
| 4 | 15 or more |
| 3 | 10 or more but less than 15 |
| 1 | 5 or more but less than 10 |
| 0 | Less than 5 |

### Case write-up assignments (Make-Up for Participation)

You can use this make-up assignment if you are **absent** during the case discussion or if your case **participation score is less than four**. **You can only submit two make-up assignments for absence, but you can submit any number of make-up assignments for a lower participation score in a case discussion.**

The three points are not automatically given but are based on the grading criteria below. If you are submitting this assignment because of a low participation score, then the highest of the two scores (write-up or participation) is taken. Your participation score will be directly updated once the write-up is evaluated and if you score higher on the write-up. Remember that the **participation incentive does not consider the score for this assignment** (see above). This has been deliberately done to incentivize participation and penalize non-participation but, at the same time, provide some amount of safety net and flexibility for students. Make-up assignment is not a substitute for participation.

The assignment is **due twice, once for the first two discussions and a second time for the last three**. You can proactively submit this assignment in advance. You can submit the write-ups for as many cases as you need.

For each case write-up, there will be two parts:

**1) Case Summary:** Summarize the case in your own words and highlight the most important aspects of the case. Use your own words, and do not copy-paste sentences/phrases directly from the case.

**2) Topic association:** Explain **how the case relates to the assigned lecture topic**. Mark the concepts and terms (in bold or highlighted). You can do any of the following for this purpose (these are only indicative and not exhaustive):
- Explain how the case helped you understand certain concepts in the assigned topic
- Explain the concepts using specific information from the case (case facts)
- Link concepts with case facts by identifying how a particular case fact relates to a particular concept
- Analyze the case using the analytical tool provided in the associated topic and elaborate on this analysis. Note: not all topics have analytical tools.
- Explain how certain case facts go beyond certain concepts or even deviate from those concepts.

The expectations are as follows:
- **The objective of the write-up:**
  - Both the Summary and Topic parts should reflect a complete and full understanding of the assigned case
  - In the topic part, clearly **connect case facts and textbook concepts** from the assigned topic. **For integrative cases, you can use any of the assigned topics.**
  - The topic part must demonstrate a full and deep understanding of the concepts from the assigned topic. Specifically, consider only the concepts utilized in this course (see session guidance, lecture video, and lecture ppt). Using concepts from other topics or those not utilized in this course will not be penalized but, at the same time, will not satisfy this criterion either.
  - Submit the write-up for the assigned case and topic only (you will get a zero if you submit for the wrong case, even if the topic is correct or vice-versa)
  - Articulate your thoughts and ideas in a clear and logical manner. You are highly encouraged to use Grammarly for your assignments. Link: https://www.fullerton.edu/it/students/software/grammarly/
- **Timing:** Upload the assignment **before the deadline indicated in Canvas**. Late submissions will be heavily penalized.
- **Format:**
  - At least **20 lines** should be dedicated to the Topic part
  - Submit a write-up that is at least **one full page** with 1-inch margins, single spaced, and font size 12. Submitting write-ups that are more than one page is highly encouraged.
  - Do not include any headers, Student name, titles, references or footnotes in your write-up.
  - Do not use indentation.
  - Use one paragraph for each of the two parts and keep the spacing between paragraphs to not more than 6 points.
  - Mark Summary or Topic at the beginning of the respective para but not on a separate line.

The following grading criteria will be used for the assignments.

| Points assigned | Expectations met |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 4 | All timing and format criteria; All of the objectives |
| 3 | Most timing and format criteria; most of the objectives |
| 1 | Some timing and format criteria; some of the objectives |
| 0 | Almost none of the timing, format, or objectives-related criteria |

### CHECK-IN QUIZZES (8 PTS)

There will be two check-in quizzes (4 pts each) that will be used to ensure that you are keeping track of all the things you need to be doing in this course and all things that you need to be aware of. Each quiz is worth four points. Following are the features of the quiz:
- You are allowed **three attempts** for each quiz, but each attempt's questions and answer choices may differ. Also, you have to wait for an hour between attempts.
- The quiz will be based on the syllabus, any information provided on Canvas, email messages sent by the professor, and any information shared in class (zoom sessions).
- The check-in quiz is **open book**; you can refer to syllabus, canvas course page, and any notes (electronic or paper) you have. You cannot message or talk to another student to find answers. Communicating with another student while taking the quiz will be considered cheating.
- Check-in quizzes have **multiple correct answers** for each question and the score will be based on the net of correct and incorrect answer choices (For an example, see: https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-Multiple-Answers-quiz-question/ta-p/924)

### EXAMINATIONS (36 PTS)

All exams will be closed book and multiple-choice based exams. They will be based **only on the concepts from the textbook and nothing from the cases will be used in the exams**. Exams will be held online during the regular class hours. If your final exam schedule for other classes clashes with this class, please contact the instructor weeks in advance. Summary of the exam format:

| Exam | Total points | Format | Topics |
|------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Midterms I | 18 | Closed book, Online, multiple choice questions, Proctorio | Chapters: 1, 2, & 3 |
| Midterms II | 18 | Closed book, Online, multiple choice questions, Proctorio | Chapters: 5, 6, & 7 |

**Note: You are only allowed one attempt for your exams. Repeat or make-up examinations are not permitted.**

### CBE ASSESSMENT (10 PTS)

**Assessment Statement**

The programs offered at the College of Business and Economics at Cal State Fullerton are designed to provide every student with the knowledge and skills essential for a successful career in business. Since assessment plays a vital role in the college's drive to offer the best, several assessment tools are implemented to constantly evaluate our program as well as our students' progress. Students, faculty and staff should expect to participate in assessment activities. In doing so, the college is able to measure its strengths and weaknesses, while continuing to cultivate a climate of excellence in its students and programs.

https://business.fullerton.edu/Assessment

In accordance with the above-mentioned assessment statement, the college has given us the responsibility to conduct the CBE Assessment. All MGMT 449 classes are asked to participate in the test. The instructors of 449 sections are merely administering the test. They will have no control over the content or the evaluation rubric of the test.

In Fall 2025 semester, we will assess three of our CBE Goals: 1b, 2, and 3b.

**Goal 1.** Students will have functional knowledge about the different business disciplines
- Objective b. Students will apply knowledge from multiple business disciplines to solve business problems

**Goal 2.** Students will have critical thinking skills
- Objective. Students will demonstrate proficiency in applying critical thinking skills to solve business problems

**Goal 3.** Students will have communication and interpersonal skills
- Objective b. Students will demonstrate effective written communication skills

**Assessment format:**
The HBS case on Trader Joe's will be used for the assessment. It will be a 90-minute assessment with a synchronous Zoom session-based proctoring (join the class Zoom session before taking the assessment). It will be open book, so you can refer to any notes, textbook, or the case itself. Other details will be shared as soon as it is provided by the college.

### STRATEGIC TEAM PROJECT: COMPANY ANALYSIS (22 PTS)

Your team will assume the role of professional consultants assigned to help the CEO solve the major problems of his or her company. You must select a company that is currently facing a significant problem. A significant problem will affect the company's growth, profitability, or its very survival. You must analyze the causes of the problems by applying the frameworks and concepts learned in this course. Then, you must recommend solutions to mitigate the problems.

Keep the following in mind when selecting your company and its problems:
- Avoid companies for which we have an assigned case in this course.
- Avoid private companies, as the information available tends to be very limited. Only consider private companies if you are confident that considerable information is available.
- Avoid companies undergoing bankruptcy or expected to file for bankruptcy.
- It is a good idea to balance practical and interesting dimensions in your choice of company/problem. A practical or pragmatic choice for your company/problem will ensure that it is easy and straightforward for you to conduct the analyses and finish your project. However, it is highly likely that you will not derive the satisfaction of a well-done project and the final scores might also be at best an average score. On the other hand, the company/problem that is very high on the interesting dimension is also very risky â€“ you may not find the right data for conducting analysis and it might take a lot of effort to bring the project to closure. Hence, find a good balance between the practical and interesting dimensions when selecting the appropriate company/problem.

This assignment carries a total of 22 points, which is broken up as shown below.

| Section/Activity | Main criteria | Max Points |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Draft | On time submission; complete one page; All sections | 2 |
| Report: Introduction | SWOT; A well developed and clearly articulated problem; Critical nature of the problem clearly explained | 3 |
| Report: Analysis | Insightful and well-structured analysis that also demonstrates a deep understanding of the analytical tools learned in the course. Avoid vague and generic statements. Pictorial representation of analysis (create your own diagrams with specific company details and do not copy the diagrams from other sources). | 10 |
| Report: Reco | Creative but pragmatic Recos; Implementation options; | 3 |
| Overall quality of the project | Clear and logical linkages from problem to analysis to recommendations; Cohesiveness across sections; language aspects. | 4 |

**Draft report (2 pts)**

By **Oct 7th, Tu** you will be submitting a draft report that is at least five pages long (you are encouraged to submit longer draft reports). It will be a draft version of the introduction and analysis part of your final report (see details in table below). The draft report should be 1-inch margin, single line spaced, and font size 12. It should include the problem statement, SWOT analysis, and at least one major analytical framework (such as 5 forces, RBV, or Value chain). At least three out of these five pages must be related to the analysis part. Even an outline of the various analytical frameworks is ok. You will receive less than the full points assigned for the draft if it does not meet the above requirements.

**Report (22 pts)**

You have to submit an electronic copy of the final report on **Dec 16th, Tu**. The total length of your final paper should be at least 12 pages (including illustrations and tables), with 1-inch margin, single line spaced, and font size 12. However, length and report format will be a secondary consideration. **The most important consideration will be your demonstrated mastery over the concepts learnt in this course and how you apply those concepts for the company under consideration.** The final paper should follow the structure in the table below. Teams can add other sections or sub-sections as needed for coherence of their final paper, but the following sections are mandatory.

#### Introduction

**Number of pages:** 2 to 5

**Expected content:**
Introduce the company by providing only the relevant details about its industry, structure, history etc. Do not provide too many unnecessary details about the company.

Conduct a **SWOT** analysis of the firm. At this stage a deep analysis is not required. Combine the most critical points from the SWOT analysis to define a **problem statement**. The problem statement should encapsulate the essence of what the firm is facing as a critical issue. Clearly indicate the specific points from your SWOT analysis that lead to this problem statement. Be pragmatic in your identification of a critical problem statement with due consideration to data availability. Do not state profitability, growth or survivability as the critical problem but argue why the selected problem is critical in terms of its impact on profitability, growth or survivability.

#### Analysis

**Number of pages:** 5 to 15

**Expected content:** This is the part where you bring structure to an unstructured problem and in the process gain a deeper and nuanced understanding of the selected problem. The easiest way to do this is by considering the topics that we discuss in the course. Re-frame the problem in terms of some of the concepts that you learnt within these topics. It is highly recommended to use MULTIPLE analytical tools/frameworks you have learnt, such as Porter's five forces, Value chain analysis, RBV, generic strategies, horizontal relationship, organization design, etc. (this is indicative and not exhaustive).

To some extent, you can speculate on the potential underlying issues based on these tools and frameworks. Restrict your speculations to internal dynamics of the firm because you can find out most of the external issues through secondary research. Depicting the analysis in pictorial form is highly recommended.

#### Recommendation

**Number of pages:** 3 to 5

**Expected content:** Based on your analysis, provide recommendations to resolve the problem. You have to explicitly link your analysis to your recommendations. Ensure that your recommendations are creative and yet pragmatic. Provide details about how the CEO can implement the recommendations. If possible, provide alternatives for implementation.

#### Citation/references

List all the sources and references you have utilized in the project report, in a separate references section at the end. Avoid using verbatim text as much as possible. If you do use verbatim text or use any pictures/illustrations from external sources, there needs to be in-line citations for those. You can use any standard format (APA, MLA etc.).

**Peer evaluations**

Teamwork is a fundamental element in this course as well as in your managerial career. Ensure that you meet with your team for all company analysis project related activities. At the end of the course you will be asked to provide **peer evaluations** of your teammates. You will distribute 100 points to all team members, excluding you. I will calculate the extent to which a member has comparatively worked, more or less than the others, on the basis of peer assessments. The grade on the team company analysis project will then be adjusted for that individual.

### SOQ EXTRA CREDIT

SOQs are really important and to encourage a high level of participation in this process, this extra credit has been devised. This is based on overall section response rates. The extra credit is given to the entire section as faculty only have access to the number of people who have responded and not the identity of the specific person who has responded. SOQs are completely anonymous.

The extra credit is determined based on the response rate at 10 am, on the final day of the SOQ submission period. If the response rate is above 90%, everyone in the section gets 1% extra credit. If the response rate is between 80 to 90 %, everyone in the section gets 0.5% extra credit. 0% if it is below the 80% response rate.

## ATTENDANCE AND LATE ENTRY POLICY

Attendance is important but the consequences of absence depend on the type of session:
- **Case-based topic and Integrative case sessions:** If you miss these sessions you will lose participation points for that case/topic. You have the option to submit the case write-up assignment as a make-up (see Case Participation section for details). **You can only submit two make-up assignments for absence**, but you can submit any number of make-up assignments for a lower participation score. In other words, **missing more than two case discussions will have serious consequences.**
- **Conceptual topic sessions:** Attendance is **mandatory** for the synchronous session. If there was an unavoidable reason for not attending, an explanation must be provided within 48 hrs of the end of the class time. **Absence will carry a penalty of 1 point.**
- **Group project work session:** The sessions designated for group project work **require every member to be available**. The penalty will be assessed in conjunction with the peer feedback.

If you arrived **late because of unavoidable circumstances**, send me an email after class with an explanation. No need to share the same during the session. You are not allowed to enter a zoom session 20 minutes after the designated start time, unless you have prior permission from the instructor.

## LATE ASSIGNMENT POLICY

Delays in submitting the assignments will be heavily penalized.

---

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY

It is expected that any work submitted for a grade or ideas shared during classroom discussions in this course will be the sole product of the individual student, unless otherwise permitted (e.g., group projects). Presenting work from other sources as your own is unacceptable and will result in a notification to the Dean of Students of a violation of campus standards. Behaviors that seek to gain an unfair advantage or negatively impact the ability of others to learn will also result in a report to the Dean of Students.

You are encouraged to use the resources provided by your instructor. Discuss the use of other online resources with your instructor. The use of sites, including but not limited to Chegg and Course Hero, which require subscriptions and provide solutions to homework problems, exam questions, etc., is explicitly prohibited in this course and is considered academic dishonesty.

Collaborating has been made easier by the many tools available to use on the internet (e.g. Discord, Zoom, Microsoft Teams). I encourage you to use these tools to work together, to form study groups, etc. However, any sharing of assignments (even if only intended to help) or using these communication tools for unauthorized collaboration is considered **academic dishonesty**. Unless otherwise explicitly stated by the instructor, **assignments, and examinations must be completed on your own**.

**University Academic Dishonesty policy:** Academic dishonesty can occur in different ways. Turnitin captures only verbatim plagiarism, but taking someone else's idea and representing it as your own is also a form of plagiarism. See university policy here: http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf

To check for potential verbatim plagiarism, use Turnitin as indicated in this link: https://help.turnitin.com/integrity/student/canvas.htm

### Course specific policy

In this course, the following are explicitly considered academic dishonesty:

1. **Case analysis:** You are supposed to structure the unstructured problem by considering the information in the case and using the concepts and analytical frameworks to make sense of it. This is reflected in the suggested prep process for the case discussion (pages 6 and 7). **YOU CANNOT USE CASE ANALYSIS AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES, INCLUDING THOSE FREELY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.** It is important for your learning process and to improve your critical thinking to do case analysis on your own for either in-class discussion or related write-ups. There is **no perfect case analysis, but many bad analyses are available on the internet**. This is detrimental to your learning as you learn the wrong things.

   Nowhere is it implied that you should use outside sources (except for the Target case; see that session guidance). Doing so is essentially equivalent to taking someone else's work and projecting it as your own.

2. **The case participation notes:** YOU CANNOT PUT SOMEONE ELSE'S COMMENTS IN CASE PARTICIPATION NOTES AND YOU CANNOT PUT SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT OF BUT COULDN'T SHARE DURING THE CLASS DISCUSSION.

3. **The write-up assignment** instructions very clearly states (page 13): "Provide **your** understanding of how the case relates to the assigned lecture topic." The word "your" pretty much precludes the use of someone else's analysis. It further elaborates on how YOU can go about doing this. **USE YOUR OWN WORDS FOR THE CASE SUMMARY PART AND DO NOT COPY PASTE SENTENCES/PHRASES DIRECTLY FROM THE CASE.**

4. **The Group project** requires collating information from multiple outside sources in order to conduct your analysis. You should cite all the sources used in your group project. **THE TEXT AND ILLUSTRATIONS RELATED TO ANALYSES MUST BE CREATED BY THE TEAM FOR THIS COURSE.** You cannot use them from your previous courses or from other outside sources. You can have some verbatim text, with appropriate citation, but keep that to a minimum. Don't use representations of various analytical frameworks such as RBV, Value chain, and Five forces from the internet or other sources, even if you are citing the source. I'm ok with other images, such as logos, product images, or financial info, being used from other sources. Do remember to cite sources for those.

**Penalty for dishonesty:** Typically, you will be given a warning. If you repeat the offense or if the offense is major, you may face a penalty that can range from points deducted to expulsion from the course or an F grade. You may also be referred to the dean of students for further action.

See the appendix for further info on University Academic Integrity, including possible consequences.

## ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY

With the rise of ChatGPT, there are significant concerns about academic integrity in higher education. However, like any new technology, it presents a threat as well as an opportunity. So this policy delineates where you can or cannot use AI assistance in your course work.

### Permitted use of AI

1. **Understanding and further exploration of concepts:** You can use tools like ChatGPT to gain further understanding of the concepts and terms from the textbook and lecture videos. However, different interpretations and applications are available for strategic management concepts and analytical frameworks. So what is taught in the course and what ChatGPT provides may be different at times. For instance, in evaluating the competitive advantage of a resource, within RBV framework, we will be using VIRS attributes, but an alternative exists in the form of VIRO. So if ChatGPT provides an explanation for VIRO instead of VIRS, you are likely to be more confused. Exercise caution and best judgement.

2. Many **language correction tools**, such as Grammarly, already incorporate AI to correct grammar and suggest better text wording. The use of tools such as Grammarly is highly encouraged.

### Banned usage of AI

1. **Case analysis:** Analyzing the case is how you learn the concepts, develop decision-making skills, and push your critical thinking. The last two aspects will have a lasting effect on your career. Besides, case analysis is done in a hundred different ways. There are specific expectations for this course. Using AI for case analysis would not only be a missed opportunity for learning important skills but can also be detrimental as you may end up with a flawed understanding. The flawed understanding might result in a lower participation score. This will also be considered a violation of academic integrity as you are using another entity's case analysis.

2. **Composing written text:** Using AI for composing any written text for submission in this course will be considered plagiarism. Penalties laid out in the previous section will become applicable in such circumstances. Written text includes make-up assignments and group project reports. After you compose the text, you can run language improvement tools such as Grammarly, but you cannot use any AI assistance beforehand.

## FINAL GRADES, GRADING STANDARDS, AND CRITERIA

Final grades represent how you perform in the class relative to other students in your section. The following items are considered when assigning final grades:
- Your total score out of the maximum achievable score of 100.
- Your relative ranking among all students in your section.
- Management department mandated GPA range for the section

Based on these considerations you will get final grades as shown in the table below.

| Total Score | Grade | GPA Score | Description |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 97~100% | A+ | 4.0 | Outstanding performance |
| 93~96.9% | A | 4.0 | |
| 90~92.9% | A- | 3.7 | |
| 87~89.9% | B+ | 3.3 | Good performance |
| 83~86.9% | B | 3.0 | |
| 80~82.9% | B- | 2.7 | |
| 77~79.9% | C+ | 2.3 | Acceptable performance |
| 70~76.9% | C | 2.0 | |
| 60~69.9% | D | 1.0 | Poor performance |
| Below 60% | F | 0.0 | |

**Netiquette (appropriate on-line behavior):**

Navigating the internet dictates that you adhere to a certain unspoken code of conduct. This on-line set of rules, called netiquette, ensures that you are not misunderstood (and that you do not offend anyone) when communicating on-line.

**Zoom Etiquette:**
- Use your webcam and put your microphone on mute during Zoom class sessions (unless instructed otherwise). If you are unable to turn on your video, add a profile picture. Test your camera position before each class begins to ensure you're centered in the camera.
- Make sure to limit distractions as much as possible during class (i.e., find a quiet space, do not browse other apps, put your phone away, etc.) to be more engaged
- Do not use inappropriate Zoom backgrounds or nicknames; this course is centered around professionalism and it is expected that you act as such
- Keep professional behavior during the Zoom session (e.g. dress appropriately for class, consider your body language, don't participate in non-course related activities)
- Keep irrelevant chat to a minimum (remember to answer discussion questions and not chat with your classmates about something not relevant to the course during in-class discussion time)
- Do not offend or enrage a classmate (be sensitive and use appropriate language); no shouting (using all capital letters); if you do not have anything nice to say, do not say it
- Do not personally record the class meeting on your device. This is a policy from campus to protect individual privacy and violating this rule can result in campus disciplinary action.

More Core Rules of Netiquette can be found at: http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html

**Student Integrity (from Titan Integrity)**

One aspect of integrity at CSUF, as in all academic communities, is academic integrity: **honesty in all academic endeavors**. Those who fail to uphold academic integrity standards not only suffer severe grade consequences, but also cheat themselves and others out of learning, degrade the value of their degree, and diminish the prestige of a CSUF education.

**What is Academic Dishonesty?**

What constitutes academic dishonesty at California State University, Fullerton is spelled out in UPS 300.021 **Academic Dishonesty Policy**. It includes, but is not limited to: plagiarism, cheating on exams, unauthorized collaboration and falsifying academic records. Abbreviated definitions follow:

**Plagiarism:** Using someone else's work in any academic assignment without appropriate acknowledgment (such as paraphrasing another's ideas or copying text, phrases or ideas from a book, journal, electronic source or another person's paper, without acknowledgment â€“ quotation marks, indentation.)

**Cheating on exams:** Unauthorized use of external assistance during an examination (such as using crib notes, talking with fellow students, or looking at another person's exam.)

**Unauthorized Collaboration:** Preparing academic assignments with another person without faculty authorization (such as discussing or sharing work on homework or projects.)

**Falsifying Academic Records:** Alteration or misrepresentation of official or unofficial records including academic transcripts, applications for admission, exam papers, registration materials, medical excuses or lab attendance forms

**What are the Consequences?**

In addition to a grade penalty ranging from "0" on an assignment to an "F" in the course, the student may also face the following sanctions: dismissal from an academic unit, revocation of admission, suspension from the university, revocation of degree and expulsion from the university.
