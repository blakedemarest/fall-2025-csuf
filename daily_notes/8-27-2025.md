# August 27, 2025 - Class Notes

## MATH 439 - Intermediate Data Analysis
**Time:** 10:00-11:50 AM  
**Location:** MH 452

### Today's Topic: Simulation of Hypothesis Testing

#### Problem Review from Monday
- 100 fail tests problem
- Now recreating using simulation approach

recap of inference on p 

theoretical (CLT approach

hnot: P = 0.2
halt: p <.2

n=100

phat = 15/100 = .15

ig hnot is true ... this is theroretical

dist for r.u phat

(i need a distribution )

#### simulated approach

- simulate an experiment under a true H_0 repeatedly!

- Each simulation... record estimate therehat or phat of unknown parameter theta or p

thetahat_1 ..... thetahat_10000


or 
phat_1....phat_10000


#### Simulation Setup
- Each simulation records estimate $\hat{\theta}$ or $\hat{p}$ of unknown parameter
- Generate sequences: $\hat{\theta}_1, \hat{\theta}_2, \ldots, \hat{\theta}_{10000}$
- Or for proportions: $\hat{p}_1, \hat{p}_2, \ldots, \hat{p}_{10000}$
