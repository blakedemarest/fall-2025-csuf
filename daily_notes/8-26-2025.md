# August 26, 2025 - Academic Setup & Course Material Organization

## Major Repository Overhaul

### Course Materials Restructuring
- **Massive file organization effort**: Converted multiple PDF syllabi and course materials to markdown format
- **MATH 320**: Reorganized textbook chapters, converted Gilat MATLAB textbook sections to markdown
- **MATH 439**: Converted Sheather regression textbook content (4000+ lines)
- **MGMT 449**: Reorganized session guidance documents, converted strategic management materials

### File Management & Cleanup
- Removed duplicate and outdated PDF files to reduce repo size
- Standardized naming conventions across all course directories
- Created unified markdown structure for better version control
- Fixed merge conflicts and repository structure issues

### Course Content Added
- **CHIC 106**: Added syllabus PDF (2.9MB) for Chicano Studies course
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated project instructions and course information
- **FALL_2025_CALENDAR.md**: Created comprehensive semester calendar with all major dates

### MATLAB Work (MATH 320)
- Started working on Chapter 1 exercises and homework problems
- Set up MATLAB project structure
- Created initial homework file (`Demarest_Blake_HW1.m`) with 125 lines of code

### Git Workflow Challenges
- Multiple merge conflicts resolved (evidenced by "UGHHHHHHH" commit messages)
- Learned to handle large file reorganization in git
- Established better workflow for managing academic materials

## Key Accomplishments
1. **Repository structure completely reorganized** for better academic workflow
2. **Course materials digitized** and converted to searchable markdown format
3. **MATLAB homework initiated** with solid foundation
4. **Semester planning tools created** (calendar, tracking systems)

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Continue MATLAB Chapter 1 homework
- Begin R work for MATH 439
- Start catching up on reading assignments
