## Course Description

In this course, we review the fundamentals of statistical modeling. We begin with a quick review of the materials covered in Math 338. We then spend some time to develop both intuition and mathematical background associated with the method of least squares. This will allow us to recast simple and multiple regressions theoretically, as well as in terms of applications. We rely on R to quantify the applicability of our inferential approaches in analyzing real-world data.

## Major Topics Discussed

- Principals in Bootstrapping
- The Least Squares Method
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Diagnostics and Outlier Detection
- Model and Variable Selection
- Bayesian Treatment of the Simple and the Multiple Regressions
- Bootstrap Approaches to the Simple and the Multiple Regressions
- Theory of Analysis of Variance
- One way Anova
- Two way Anova, factorial designs
- The split-plot design
- Model Diagnostics for Anova
- Introduction to ANCOVA
- Introduction to generalized linear model
- Logistic regression
- Poisson Regression

## Grading

### Grade Components

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Homework Assignments (6 total) | 15% |
| Case Studies (2-3 total) | 20% |
| Midterm Exam 1 | 15% |
| Midterm Exam 2 | 15% |
| Final Exam | 35% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

### Grading Scale

Grades in this class shall roughly be curved under the following criteria. I do give +/- as well.

| Grade | Approximate Percentile |
|-------|------------------------|
| A | Top 10% |
| B | Next 20% |
| C | Next 40% |
| D | Next 20% |
| F | Bottom 10% |

That means that your raw course score will be calculated and then grades will be assigned using a cumulative distribution function. If the class as a whole performs above expectations, a larger portion of A's can be appropriated. The opposite is also true, should the class perform below expectation, a higher proportion of C's, D's and F's will be assigned.

## Course Policies

### Homework

There will be a total of 6 homework assignments. They will be worth 15% of your overall course grade. The number of homeworks may be adjusted throughout the semester but will always account for 15% of your grade.

### Case Studies

There are going to be two to three Case Studies throughout the semester. Case studies will count for 20% of your overall course grade.

### Exams

There are two midterm exams in this course and they shall be equally weighted at 15% each. The final will be inherently cumulative.

## Important Dates

**IMPORTANT:** The last date to add or drop a class in the math department is **September 10th**. After that dropping will result in a "W". **September 18th** is the last day the math department will be flexible on the approval of late withdrawal requests, **November 15th** is the last day to withdraw with a "W."

## Academic Policies

### Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty shall be addressed using University protocol. Please review your student handbook. I expect all work done on quizzes and exams to be your own work. Any indication otherwise is deemed academic dishonesty. It is okay and actually encouraged for students to work together on homework and labs.

### Make-up Exams

There will be no make up exams except in the cases of documented emergencies. Should you require a make up exam due to an emergency and you have sufficient documentation please contact me to set up a make up exam time.

### Special Accommodations

If you have special needs I encourage you to contact me so I can help you get in contact with University special services so that we can get you the resources that you need.

### Syllabus Changes

I can promise that changes will be made to the overall course throughout the quarter. Think of this syllabus more as a guideline than something set in stone. I reserve the right to amend anything in this syllabus from content to grades.
